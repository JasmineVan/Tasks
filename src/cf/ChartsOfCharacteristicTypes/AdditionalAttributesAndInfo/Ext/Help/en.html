<p>Additional attributes and info are used in <a href="Catalog.AdditionalAttributesAndInfoSets/Help">property sets</a>. <br>All additional attributes and info of objects can be displayed in reports and lists.</p>
<p>When choosing an additional property, follow the guidelines below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Additional attributes</strong> are an integral part of an object with properties. They are stored in the tabular section of the object and are available to users who have an access to the object with properties. Additional attributes are edited in the object window similarly to other attributes. 
</li><li><strong>Additional info</strong> is used to store object info that is not an integral part of the object. Generally, additional object info is available for viewing and editing to users who have no access to the object with properties itself. Additional info is edited in a dedicated window accessible from the window of the object with properties.</li></ul><p>Upon choosing the <strong>Additional value</strong> or <strong>Additional value (hierarchy)</strong> value type, you can set a <a href="Catalog.ObjectsPropertiesValues/Help">list of possible values</a> or <a href="Catalog.ObjectPropertyValueHierarchy/Help">values with hierarchy</a> of an additional attribute or info. To do this, click <strong>Create</strong> in the window of the <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalAttributesAndInfo.Form.ItemForm/Help">additional attribute or info</a>.</p>
