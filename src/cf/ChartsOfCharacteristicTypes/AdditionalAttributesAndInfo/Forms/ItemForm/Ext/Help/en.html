Fill in this field on the <strong>Comment</strong> tab.</li></ul><h3>Adding additional attributes or info from another set</h3>
<ul><li>In the application, you can use previously entered additional attributes and info for other sets. 
</li><li>This method is most useful for additional attributes and info of the <strong>Additional value</strong> and <strong>Additional value (hierarchy)</strong> types. If appropriate settings are made (at least one of the check boxes in the <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong> section is selected), the <strong>Add</strong> button becomes available. 
</li><li>Select an additional attribute or info set, click <strong>Add</strong>, and in the drop-down list, click <strong>From other set</strong>. 
</li><li>Wizard of adding an additional attribute or info opens. 
<ul><li>In the left part of the first wizard page, you can see the list of previously entered attributes or info. 
</li><li>In the right part, values and other parameters of the selected attribute are displayed.</li></ul></li><li>Select an additional attribute or info on the first wizard page. Note that you cannot create an additional attribute or info in this list. 
<ul><li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to choose an option of adding an additional attribute or info. 
</li><li>You can also add an attribute from one set to another one by dragging it. If appropriate settings are made, the second page of the <strong>Add additional attribute or info</strong> wizard opens.</li></ul></li><li>On the second wizard page, using the radio button, choose an option of adding an additional attribute or info: 
<ul><li><font color="#0066cc"><a href="#1">Copy attribute</a></font> to create the same additional attribute or info in the set. 
</li><li><font color="#0066cc"><a href="#2">Copy attribute by sample</a></font> to create an additional attribute or info with a common value list. The <strong>Attributes and info with common value list</strong> check box in the <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong> section is to be selected. 
</li><li><font color="#0066cc"><a href="#3">Add common attribute to set</a></font> to make an additional attribute or info common. In this case, not the value list becomes common but the attribute itself. The <strong>Common attributes and info</strong> check box in the <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong> section is to be selected.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a name="#1">Copying additional attributes or info</a></h3>
<ul><li>In the application, you can copy additional attributes or info. 
</li><li>In this case, a copy is created for a set of additional attributes or info. This copy is an independent additional attribute or info with its own value list, and it is not linked with the original based on which it is created. 
</li><li>Depending on settings, there are several options: 
<ul><li>In the wizard of adding new additional attributes and info. 
<ul><li>Select a set of additional attributes in the list, and then click <strong>Add - From other set</strong>. 
</li><li>On the first wizard page, select an attribute to copy in the attribute list, and then click <strong>Next</strong>. 
</li><li>On the second wizard page, using the radio button, select <strong>Copy attribute</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>. 
</li><li>Fill in the rest of fields. After you copy the attribute, the value list is available for editing.</li></ul></li><li>By dragging. 
<ul><li>You can drag an additional attribute or info from one set to another one. 
</li><li>If a list contains the <strong>Add</strong> button, the second page of the Add additional attribute or info wizard opens. 
</li><li>If a list contains only the <strong>Create</strong> button, the card of the additional attribute or info to copy opens. Fill in the rest of fields.</li></ul></li><li>By clicking <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong>. 
<ul><li>Select an additional attribute or info, and then click <strong>Copy</strong>. Select a set to which you want to add this additional attribute or info. Click <strong>Paste</strong>. If appropriate settings are made, the second page of the Add additional attribute or info wizard opens. If the selected additional attribute or info is already included in a set, the application suggests that you make it common. 
</li><li>The <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong> commands are also available in the context menu, which opens by right-clicking an attribute, or in the <strong>More actions</strong> menu.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3><a name="#2">Adding additional attributes or info by sample</a></h3>
<ul><li>To be able to use this option, select the <strong>Attributes and info with common value list</strong> check box in <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong>. 
</li><li>You can use previously entered attributes and info from other sets and add attributes with a common value list for several attributes of the same type (for example, the <strong>Door color</strong> attribute by sample of the <strong>Color</strong> attribute). In this case, a value list of the sample attribute is used. It is convenient to configure a value list for several attributes of the same type at once. 
</li><li>
<div>Select a set from the list.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Click <strong>Add - From other set</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>The list of all additional attributes or info already existing in the application opens. Select an additional attribute or info from the <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalAttributesAndInfo.Form.ChoiceForm/Help"><font color="#0066cc">list</font></a> of ones already existing in the application. Click <strong>Next</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>
<div>Using the radio button, select <strong>Copy attribute by sample</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</div></div>
</li><li>
<div>Type and all values of the selected additional attribute or info will be copied to the new item. </div>
</li><li>
<div>Fill in all required fields. By default, the attribute becomes common to the source set. In this case, you cannot enter new values. You will see a message informing you that the value list is common to another attribute.</div>
</li><li>
<div>After the additional attribute or info is saved, using the link, you can view the sample attribute and add values if necessary.</div>
</li><li>You can make an attribute created by sample that has a value list common to another attribute independent. 
<ul><li>Click <strong>Change</strong>. The <strong>Change additional attribute or info settings</strong> window opens. In this window, click <strong>Attribute with its own value list</strong> and save your changes. The value list will be copied and links in documents will be replaced. After that, you will be able to enter the value list. 
</li><li><strong>Warning:</strong> Use this conversion for already existing attributes (used for entering in documents) with caution. Attribute conversion is irreversible. The document update procedure can be performed automatically, but this is time-consuming and error-prone. We recommend that you modify the existing documents by manually deleting the old reference values and adding the new ones instead.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a name="#3">Adding common additional attributes or info</a></h3>
<ul><li>A common attribute is included in multiple sets. This option is suitable when not only a value list but also the attribute itself is to be common. In lists and reports on catalog and document items, common attributes are grouped and shown as a single attribute in one column or field. For example, using common attribute <strong>Color</strong>, you can filter all yellow clothes and shoes. 
</li><li>To be able to use this option, select the <strong>Additional attributes and info</strong> check box in <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong>. 
</li><li>
<div>To add a common additional attribute or info to a set, select the set, and then click <strong>Add - From other set</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Select a <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalAttributesAndInfo.Form.ChoiceForm/Help">common additional attribute or information</a> from the suggested <font color="#0066cc">list</font>. Select <strong>Next</strong>. </div>
</li><li>The second wizard page opens. Using the radio button, select <strong>Make attribute common and add it to set</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>. The common additional attribute opens. 
</li><li>
<div>You can also add a common additional attribute or info by dragging it or by clicking <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>To add a common attribute to multiple sets, repeat these actions for each set.</div>
</li><li>When a common additional attribute (common additional data) is included in one or more sets, the <strong>Common attribute (common data) is included in sets</strong> link will be displayed at the bottom of its window with the list of sets. 
</li><li>To convert a common attribute to an independent attribute with its own value list, click <strong>Change</strong>. You will find the button next to the link. 
<ul><li>The <strong>Change additional attribute or info settings</strong> window opens. In this window, click <strong>Attribute with its own value list</strong> and save your changes. The value list will be copied and links in documents will be replaced. 
</li><li><strong>Warning!</strong> Reconfiguration of the additional attribute (data) is irreversible and may take an excessive amount of time depending on the number of documents where the attribute is used. We recommend that you create a new attribute with a specific value list and perform a transition between these attributes manually (by clearing old attribute values and filling in new values).</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a name="#4">Additional attribute or info value types</a></h3>
<p>Additional attribute or info value types vary depending on usage logic. The following additional attribute or info value types are available:</p>
<ul><li><strong>String</strong>. Determine the string <strong>Length</strong>, select the <strong>Fixed</strong> or <strong>Variable</strong> option (if the entered string is less than the expected length, the number of characters reserved for this value will be automatically reduced to the actual). In this case, the maximum string length is 1024 characters. If very long strings are expected, select the <strong>Unlimited</strong> check box. 
<ul><li>You can make the field with multiple lines for attributes of the <strong>Line</strong> type. To use the multiline input field, select <strong>Multiline input field</strong> check box and specify number of lines. </li></ul></li><li>Select <strong>Length</strong> and <strong>Precision</strong> of the <strong>number</strong>. The default number length is 15, and default precision is 3. These values may vary depending on the input data. Keep in mind that number<strong> Length</strong> includes both integer and fractional parts, as well as the decimal point. Select <strong>Positive only</strong> check box if necessary. 
<ul><li>When entering additional attributes of the <strong>Number</strong> type, you can specify the number format more precisely. 
<ul><li>The entered numbers will be rounded to conform to values of <strong>Length</strong> and <strong>Precision</strong> fields in <strong>Format line wizard</strong>. 
</li><li>You can select <strong>Shift</strong>. 
</li><li>You can change the <strong>Decimal separator</strong> (it is a comma by default), and specify the <strong>Group separator</strong> (it is space by default) and the <strong>Grouping</strong>. 
</li><li>You can select <strong>Presentation of zero</strong>, for example, to remind the users that they should fill in the field. 
</li><li>You can also select <strong>Presentation of negative numbers</strong>. 
</li><li>You can select <strong>Display leading zeroes</strong> check box, if necessary. Then, if the actual number length is less than the specified <strong>Length</strong>, the remaining leading digits will be filled in with zeroes.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Warning!</strong> Some format settings (for example, blank number presentation, long date and so on) are not applied automatically in many places and are supported only where the developer has made it possible (for example, in printed forms). 
<ul><li>They are inapplicable in object cards.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Date</strong>. Select date components: <strong>Date</strong>, <strong>Time</strong> or <strong>Date and Time</strong>. 
<ul><li>To specify date format for additional attributes, click <strong>Default format</strong> link. You can select <strong>dd.mm.yyyy</strong> or <strong>yyyy-MM-dd</strong> formats as well as the <strong>Local date format</strong> (for example, <strong>22 May 2013</strong>), set the <strong>Blank date presentation</strong> (a blank field will display a warning, for example, <strong>Date is missing</strong>). 
<ul><li><strong>Warning!</strong> Some format settings (for example, blank number presentation, long date and so on) are not applied automatically in many places and are supported only where the developer has made it possible (for example, in printed forms). 
</li><li>They are inapplicable in object cards.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Composite data type</strong>. This value type allows to finally select data type when entering data into a catalog Select <strong>Composite data type</strong> check box, then select check boxes for all data types allowed for the attribute. 
<ul><li>For example, user may be unaware of a specific date, such as the date of company registration. In this case, users should be allowed to choose between <strong>Date</strong> and <strong>String</strong> data types. If the exact date is known, then it will be possible to select the <strong>Date</strong> type and enter, if it is unknown, then you can enter the date in the form of the line, for example "Beginning of the 19th century.". 
</li><li>Each data type included in the composite data type can be customized as usual, including date format, string parameters, and more. 
</li><li>When entering an additional attribute value of composite data type, you have to specify the data type first.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Boolean</strong>. Usually these are values like <strong>True</strong> or <strong>False</strong>, <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>. 
<ul><li>You can modify the format of these values in <strong>Format line wizard</strong> for additional attributes. You can specify <strong>Representation of boolean False</strong> and <strong>Representation of boolean True</strong>. In this case, the users will be prompted to choose between values specified by the user, instead of generic <strong>Yes</strong> and <strong>No</strong>. 
<ul><li><strong>Warning!</strong> Selection of such additional attributes with the <strong>Equal</strong> and <strong>Not equal</strong> conditions is not supported in lists and reports.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Additional value</strong> data type is frequently used, and the input of information is reduced to the selection of values from the list. This is the default data type. Both standard and grouped value lists are used. Additional attributes (data) of <strong>Additional value</strong> type can be used to describe any properties of applied objects. 
</li><li><strong>Additional value (hierarchy)</strong> structure is widely used. It is also called item hierarchy. Items of such list have identical properties, but they can have subordinate items. The hierarchy can be very complex. 
</li><li><strong>User</strong>. In the application you can use values of the <strong>Users</strong> list (and other lists) as additional attributes (data).</li></ul><h3>Special features of additional data, such as Additional value or Additional value (hierarchy)</h3>
<ul><li>Besides standard fields, the following fields are available: 
<ul><li>To <strong>Use weight coefficients for values</strong>, select the check box. This field can later be used for analysis in reports. You need to think through the usage logic if this field yourself. This field is optional. 
</li><li><strong>Value form title</strong>. Enter the <a href="Catalog.ObjectsPropertiesValues.Form.ItemForm/Help">item input windows</a> (<a href="Catalog.ObjectPropertyValueHierarchy.Form.ItemForm/Help">hierarchical item input windows</a>) header. 
</li><li><strong>Value selection form title</strong>. Enter the <a href="Catalog.ObjectsPropertiesValues/Help">value selection windows</a> (<a href="Catalog.ObjectPropertyValueHierarchy/Help">hierarchical value selection windows</a>) header. We recommend that you specify personalized titles for additional attribute (data) input and value selection windows, thus facilitating user input.</li></ul></li><li>After selecting data type and filling in <strong>Name</strong> field, click <strong>Save</strong>. Then, value list will become available. To enter values, click <strong>Create</strong>. Enter the required fields. 
</li><li>If you did not save the entered data before clicking <strong>Create</strong>, a warning will be displayed. To proceed with entering values, click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Changing format of additional attributes and data</h3>
<ul><li>After saving, no further changes can be made to value types or format of additional attributes and data. Instead, you will have to delete the existing additional attributes or data, and then create them again, with proper value types.</li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
