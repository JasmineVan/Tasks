<p>This list is used to view object change history and choose between stored versions. Version history quickly answers the following questions: "Who changed the object?", "When were changes made?", and "What was changed in the object?". </p>
<p>This is a useful tool for document or list change history management, object version viewing, and object version comparison.</p>
<p>Before you can start working with object change history, you need to perform the initial object versioning <a href="InformationRegister.ObjectVersioningSettings/Help">setup</a>. Only the application administrator can view or set up version history.</p>
<p>To view version history for a list or a document, use the <strong>Change history</strong> command located on its navigation panel. This command is available only to the application administrator, and only for the objects that support versioning.</p>
<p>The list includes the following columns:</p>
<ul><li><strong>#</strong> - version number. Versions are listed in descending order, with version 1 listed last; 
</li><li><strong>Change author</strong> - name of user that made changes to the object; 
</li><li><strong>Date</strong> - object change date and time; 
</li><li><strong>Comment</strong> - add detailed information about this version (this feature is available to users with full access). For example, this can help analyse changes in a document. This field is filled in automatically. For example, after a version upgrade, new version number and upgrade date are added to Comment.</li></ul><h3>Versions filtering</h3>

<ul><li>
<div>Upon adding and recording changes, you can use the <strong>Technical details on the object change</strong> link to view the <a href="DataProcessor.EventLog/Help">event log</a> filtered by events associated with this object.</div></li></ul><h3>Viewing versions</h3>
<ul><li>Click <strong>Open version</strong> to view the report describing object status on a given date.</li></ul><h3>Comparing versions</h3>
<ul><li>Select two or more versions in the object version list and click <strong>Compare versions</strong> to view the report describing object changes between the selected versions.</li></ul><h3>Version rollback</h3>
<ul><li>To roll an object back to an earlier version, select a version and click <strong>Go to version</strong>. Any changes introduced after this version was saved will be canceled. </li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
