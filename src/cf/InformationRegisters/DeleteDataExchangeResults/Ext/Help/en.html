<p>This form is used to review statistics based on data synchronization results.</p>
<p><a href="CommonForm.DataSynchronization/Help">Data synchronization</a> results are available as a reference in the <strong>Data synchronization</strong> list, which can be accessed from the application desktop or other locations. Depending on the results, the reference has either the <strong>No warnings</strong> value (in case of successful data synchronization) or the <strong><img src="CommonPicture.Warning"></img>Warnings</strong> value (with the number of warnings in brackets). To open the list of data synchronization result, click the reference. </p>
<p>During data synchronization, problems may occur that require <a href="Catalog.Users.Form.ItemForm/Help">user</a> intervention. The list contains description of data that caused synchronization problems and the causes of there problems. The causes are briefly described in a separate column; click any cause to display detailed information at the bottom of the list, including the names of list fields or document fields where problems occurred.</p>
<h3>Filters</h3>
<p>For your convenience, the following filters can be enabled:</p>
<ul><li><img src="StdPicture.InputFieldSelect"></img><strong>Select</strong> the <strong>Period</strong> for which to issue data. 
</li><li>In the <strong>From</strong> field, <img src="StdPicture.InputFieldSelect" width="12" height="12"></img><strong>Select</strong> a specific infobase from the list. 
</li><li>In the <strong>Cause</strong> field, type in a specific error cause (this filter is not available on the <strong>Conflicts</strong> tab). </li></ul><p>All data synchronization problems can be roughly broken down into the following categories (each category being displayed on a separate list tab). In the header of each tab, the number of the following problems is indicated in brackets:</p>
<ul><li>
<h3>Unposted documents</h3>
</li><li>This list displays the documents that could not be posted for any reason. To fix a document posting problem, we recommend that you open the document and eliminate any inconsistencies that prevent posting (for example, insufficient product balance). The cause that prevents document posting is displayed at the bottom of the list. 
</li><li>To start fixing errors in the selected documents, click <strong>Change selected</strong>. 
</li><li>Once all errors are fixed, <strong>Post</strong> the document again. 
</li><li>To open the document, click <strong>More - Change</strong>. 
</li><li>To hide the document from the list without fixing the posting problems, click <strong>Ignore</strong>. 
</li><li>To display the ignored documents, click <strong>More - Show ignored</strong>. 
</li><li>To return the ignored document to the list, click <strong>More - Do not ignore</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Blank attributes</h3>
<ul><li>This list displays blank attributes of catalog items. To fix this problem, open the related catalog item by double-clicking it and fill in all required fields. Then save the item. 
</li><li>To fill in the attributes of selected items, click <strong>Change selected</strong>. 
</li><li>To open the item, click <strong>More - Change</strong>. 
</li><li>To delete the catalog item from the list without elimination of filling in the mandatory attributes, click <strong>Ignore</strong>. 
</li><li>To display the ignored items, click <strong>More - Show ignored</strong>. 
</li><li>To return the ignored item to the list, click <strong>More - Do not ignore</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Conflicts</h3>
<ul><li>When data synchronization between two applications is enabled, the same data may change in both applications nearly simultaneously (between two data synchronization sessions). In this case, the next data synchronization session will encounter two different versions of the same data. This is called a data change conflict. The <br>Data change conflicts are resolved automatically by prioritizing one of the two available data versions; however, you can override the conflict resolution manually. For this, select a list item. 
</li><li>Description of the conflict resolution automatically chosen by the application will be displayed at the bottom of the list. 
</li><li>To review differences between two data versions, click <strong>Show differences</strong>. 
</li><li>Before you decide which data version should be prioritized, you may want to review both versions. To do that, click <strong>More - Show version created in this infobase</strong> or <strong>More - Show version received from another infobase</strong>. 
</li><li>To view the list item, click <strong>More - Change data</strong>. 
</li><li>Once you decide which data version to preserve, click <strong>Confirm</strong> to save the result of the automatic resolution of the conflict, or click <strong>Revise</strong> to change the conflict resolution to the opposite. After that, the item becomes inactive, it is assigned the <strong><img src="CommonPicture.DataSynchronizationDataReceived"></img>Reviewed</strong> flag, and it is hidden from the list by default. 
</li><li>All resolved conflicts are hidden from the conflict list by default. To display these conflicts, click <strong>More - Show resolved conflicts</strong>. 
</li><li>To re-review a resolved conflict and make changes to it, click <strong>More - Remove the Reviewed flag</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Items rejected due to restriction date</h3>
<ul><li>This list displays data rejected because they belong to a date period for which any data import is restricted. 
</li><li>To compare the declined data with the current application data, click <strong>Show differences</strong> (provided that data is available in the current application). 
</li><li>To open the item, click <strong>More - Change</strong>. 
</li><li>To review the other data version, click <strong>More -</strong> <strong>Show rejected version</strong>. 
</li><li>To import data regardless of any data import restrictions, click <strong>Accept version</strong>. 
</li><li>To delete the row from the list without making any decision on it, click <strong>Ignore</strong>. 
</li><li>To display the ignored items, click <strong>More - Show ignored</strong>. 
</li><li>To return the ignored item to the list, click <strong>More - Do not ignore</strong>.</li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
