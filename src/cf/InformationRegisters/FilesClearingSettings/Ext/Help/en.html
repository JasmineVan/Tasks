<p>The tool is designed to clean up space on the disk used by unnecessary files (obsolete, or added by mistake).</p>
<p>The application allows you to reduce the amount of data used to store unnecessary files. Unnecessary files are files that are no longer needed, for example, after a certain period of time.</p>
<p>The application provides you with a tool to configure rules to delete unnecessary files according to the file properties and properties and types of their owners. You can also delete these files by using a scheduled job. </p>
<p>Obsolete file versions can also be deleted.</p>
<p>To open it, click <strong>Configure file cleanup</strong> in the <strong>Administration - File operation settings</strong> section.</p>
<p>For example, you can configure cleanup of attachments with low importance for the <strong>Incoming email message</strong> documents created more than a year ago.</p>
