<ul><li><strong>Owner</strong>. Application object. If a number is used in several application objects, you can see it in the list. 
</li><li><strong>Number</strong>. Number of a scanned file.</li></ul><h3>Resetting scanned file numbers</h3>
<ul><li>During scanning, you might need to reset numbering of scanned files (start from zero) for a particular file owner (file folder, or list item). For example, if several images were scanned as a test, and after that documents must be scanned and assigned correct numbers. 
</li><li>To do so, select a file owner, and then set the value number to 0.</li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
