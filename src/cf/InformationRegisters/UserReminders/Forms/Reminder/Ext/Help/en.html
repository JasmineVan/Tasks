<p>In the application you can enter reminders by specifying the time and subject, about which the program will display a <a href="InformationRegister.UserReminders.Form.NotificationForm/Help">list of reminders</a> at the specified time.</p>
<p>The subject of reminders can be various catalogs, documents and other applied objects. For example, a reminder can be entered for a specific partner, goods movement document, etc., in order to remember to clarify or fill in any data.</p>
<p>To open it, click <img src="CommonPicture.Reminder" width="16" height="16"></img><strong>Organizer - Remind</strong> in distinct applied objects. In this case, you can enter only one reminder for one object.</p>
<p>You can enter a reminder connected with some personal event or task in the <a href="InformationRegister.UserReminders.Form.MyReminders/Help">My reminders</a> list by the <strong>Create</strong> command. Such reminder can be useful not to forget to congratulate colleagues on their birthdays on time. Also you can use reminders together with <a href="Catalog.Notes/Help">notes</a> as an electronic replacement for "stickers on the edges of the monitor".</p>
<h3>Entering a reminder</h3>
<ul><li>Edit or write text of a reminder. 
</li><li>If the reminder is connected with a document, catalog or another applied object, then the <strong>Subject</strong> field contains a link to the program object, its description will be inserted in the reminder text by default. 
<ul><li>Using the link in the <strong>SubjectSSL</strong> field, you can view the program object for which the reminder was created. </li></ul></li><li>Select one of the following options in the <strong>Remind</strong> field: 
<ul><li><strong>At the specified time</strong> is used to specify the exact date and time of the reminder. Enter the date manually or select it from the calendar clicking the <img src="StdPicture.InputFieldCalendar"></img> button. 
</li><li><strong>In a certain period of time</strong>. To do this, select a value from the list to set the period of time in which the reminder will activate. You can also use the keyboard to specify an arbitrary number of hours, for example, <strong>in 10 hours</strong>. The application automatically calculates the date and time of the reminder and displays it in brackets next to the <strong>Remind</strong> field. 
</li><li><strong>Relative to subjectSSL</strong> is used to specify the time of the reminder in relation to the date in the reminder subject, for example, relative to the execution date in the task. This value of the <strong>Remind</strong> field is displayed and suggested by the application by default, when the item has at least one field with a date in the future. Select from the list how <strong>early</strong> <strong>before the Date</strong> you need a reminder to be displayed. If such a date in the subjectSSL changes, the reminder time changes automatically. If the date in the subjectSSL is reset for some reason, then the reminder period will be considered as approached and the reminder will be displayed ahead of schedule. 
</li><li><strong>Periodically</strong> is used for periodic reminders, for example, you can select from the list the <strong>on Mondays at 9 a.m.</strong> value, or enter a different schedule. To enter your schedule, select the value from the list <strong>according to the specified schedule</strong> and make the necessary settings.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Cancelling a reminder</h3>
