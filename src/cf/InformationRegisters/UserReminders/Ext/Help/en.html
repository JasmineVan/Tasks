<p>In the application you can enter reminders by specifying the time and subject, about which the program will display a list of reminders at a specified time.</p>
<p>The subject of reminders can be various catalogs, documents and other applied objects. For example, a <a href="InformationRegister.UserReminders.Form.Reminder/Help">reminder</a> can be entered for a specific partner, goods movement document, etc., in order to remember to clarify or fill in any data.</p>
<p>To open it, click <img src="CommonPicture.Organizer"></img><strong>Organizer - Remind</strong> in distinct applied objects. In this case, you can enter only one reminder for one object.</p>
<p>You can enter a reminder connected with some personal event or task in the <a href="InformationRegister.UserReminders.Form.MyReminders/Help">My reminders</a> list by the <strong>Create</strong> command. Such reminder can be useful not to forget to congratulate colleagues on their birthdays on time. Also you can use reminders together with <a href="Catalog.Notes/Help">notes</a> as an electronic replacement for "stickers on the edges of the monitor".</p>
<h3>Reminder list:</h3>
<ul><li>At the time specified in the reminder, the application opens the <strong>Reminders</strong> list. The list contains all newly created and deferred reminders, which notification time is up. Each reminder displays its text and time, for how much it was overdue. If a reminder is connected to date of some subject, for example, with the due date for a task, then the reminder indicates how much time is left before the event starts. 
</li><li>From the list, you can go to the catalog item or the document to which the reminder is connected (click <strong>Open</strong> or double-click the item). If the reminder is not connected to the program object, then the reminder will open itself. 
</li><li>To cancel the selected reminders and delete them from the list, click <strong>Stop</strong>. Periodic reminder after clicking <strong>Stop</strong> continues to operate according to the configured schedule. You can completely stop this reminder in the <a href="InformationRegister.UserReminders.Form.MyReminders/Help">My Reminders</a> list. 
</li><li>You can defer all reminders in the list for a period of time, specified in the <strong>Remind in</strong> field by clicking <strong>Defer all</strong>. To fill in the <strong>Remind in</strong> field, select value from the list or use the keyboard, specifying an arbitrary time value.</li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
