<p>The panel displays <a href="Catalog.ReportsOptions/Help">report options</a> available in a section or in one of the section's groups. </p>
<p>You can open the reports panel by the matching command from the application sections, for example, in the <b>Administration-Maintenance-Reports and Processing</b> section there is the <b>Administrator reports</b> command.</p>
<p>The report panel provides a place to work with reports and groups report options by command interface groups. You can use the report panel in two modes: </p>
<ul><li>in the <a href="#1">view</a> mode; 
</li><li>in the <a href="#2">setup</a> mode.</li></ul><h3><a name="#1">View</a> mode</h3>
<ul><li>When the report panel is opened for the first time, a notification will be displayed. It informs that descriptions will be displayed together with reports. The application allows you to choose whether you would like to leave descriptions enabled or to disable them. You can also make this choice in the setup mode. 
</li><li>Report panel groups match groups of the application section where the report is located. 
<ul><li>The report panel can also include other grouping types depending on the specific report list. 
</li><li>There is the <strong>See also</strong> group. It usually consists of report options that are rarely used in the application. 
</li><li>Important reports are marked in <strong>bold</strong> in the report panel. 
</li><li>You can set up these groups in the <a href="Catalog.ReportsOptions/Help">all reports</a> list.

</li><li>report option field presentations; 
</li><li>presentations of report option filters and parameters;
