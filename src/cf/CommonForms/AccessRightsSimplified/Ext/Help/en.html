<p>This form is used for simplified setting of access rights.</p>
<p>User access rights management is profile-based. A profile defines a set of actions with the application data the user is allowed to perform. Generally, profiles correspond to user job functions or duties. Multiple profiles can be assigned to the user at the same time, these profiles collectively defining their personal access rights settings.</p>
<p>To set up <a href="Catalog.Users.Form.ItemForm/Help">user</a> (<a href="Catalog.ExternalUsers.Form.ItemForm/Help">external user</a>) access rights, execute the <strong>Access rights</strong> command located on the navigation panel.</p>
<h3>Profiles</h3>
<ul><li>In the <strong>Profiles</strong> list, select check boxes for the profiles required for the user's application activities. 
</li><li>Generally, a profile incorporates several roles. Assigning a profile to user automatically assigns them all roles contained in the profile. For example, the <strong>Administrator</strong> profile contains the <strong>Full rights</strong> role granting unlimited access to all data. Only application administrators (users with the <strong>Administrator</strong> profile) can set up user access rights. 
</li><li>All profiles are broken down into two categories: 
<ul><li>Primary profiles define a set of access rights sufficient to perform specific activities in the application. 
</li><li>Using the additional profiles, a user can be given auxiliary rights in addition to the main ones. Access kinds</li></ul></li><li>This list is displayed to the right of the profile list, provided that the <strong>Use record-level security</strong> check box is selected in the <strong>Administration - User and rights settings</strong> section. The <strong>Access kind</strong> field is used to precisely define the data area accessible to the user. 
</li><li><strong>Access kind</strong> is a some kind of rule that allows access to the application data. For example, using the <strong>Companies</strong> access kind, you can allow users to work only with documents on specific companies, or vice versa, hide documents of some companies from them. 
<ul><li>Contents of the access kind list may vary depending on the profile selected in the profile list (to the left). In addition, the profile also determines how the access kind setting works: whether it allows only to view or also to edit documents. For example, if a profile includes the <strong>Goods receipt</strong> document read role, users with this profile are only allowed to view these documents. If the profile contains a role of adding and editing, then it becomes possible to edit such documents.</li></ul></li><li>You need to specify <strong>Access values</strong> for each access kind. Select <strong>All prohibited</strong> or <strong>All allowed</strong> from the list, or specify exceptions. 
<ul><li>Any access kind can be set up by two methods: 
<ul><li>Specify the allowed value list. We recommend that you use this setup method when you need to grant the users access to a specific limited data area. 
</li><li>Specify the prohibited value list. 
<ul><li>This setting method is convenient in cases when you need to lock access to a previously known data area, and to all new values entered into the program, the allowing rules should be applied by default. 
</li><li>For example, if using the <strong>Companies</strong> access kind the right is set that prohibits to work with the documents by the Forward Thinking company, these restriction will not be applied to the new company New Tech, added to the application later. 
</li><li>Please keep in mind that "allow" settings have priority over "prohibit" settings. If in the example above, the user is allowed to enter documents on the Forward Thinking company in some other group with the same profile, then in the end the user will get access to all documents on this company. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>To create exceptions, click <strong>Add</strong> and select the required values from list. 
</li><li>In some cases, to simplify the setting of access rights, you can specify not individual elements, but the entire groups of elements in the list of allowed or prohibited values. 
<ul><li>For example, if you set up the <strong>Partners</strong> access kind to prohibit access to some of the partners, you can specify partner access groups instead of individual partners. For this, you will need to create the list of partner access groups, and assign each partner to a group. 
<ul><li>These activities are not limited to administrators; any user with sufficient rights to edit the partner list can perform this.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>The Users access kind</h3>
<ul><li>For some profiles, the <strong>Users</strong> (<strong>External users</strong>) access kind can be used for access rights setup. 
</li><li>This applies only to the documents (and other application objects) containing fields that can be used to specify users allowed to access these documents (such as <strong>Person responsible</strong>, <strong>Author</strong>, and <strong>Performer</strong>). 
</li><li>To grant access to all restricted data available to a specific user, you need to add this user to the allowed value list for the <strong>Users</strong> access kind. 
</li><li>For example, if access to goods and service receipt documents is governed by the <strong>Responsible person</strong> field value, then a user will be able to save documents where <strong>Responsible person</strong> matches the user or added to the list of allowed for the <strong>Users</strong> access kind. 
</li><li>The prohibiting setting acts in the same way.</li></ul><h3>Access rights report</h3>
<ul><li>To view the full list of user access rights, including the full list of applied objects and access rights per object granted to this user (user group), <a href="Report.AccessRights/Help">User access rights report</a> can be generated. 
</li><li>Click <strong>Access rights report</strong>.</li></ul><h3>View unused access kinds</h3>
