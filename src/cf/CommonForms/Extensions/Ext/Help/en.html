<p>Use this list to add configuration extensions to the application. Configuration extensions add new functionality without changing the application directly.</p>

<p>The list includes the following columns: </p>
<ul><li>The check box column. Select or clear the check box to attach or detach available extensions.

</li><li>Once an extension is added, click <strong>restart</strong> for the change to take effect. This link is not available in internet applications as extensions are not attached when shared users (for example, service administrators) enter the data area.
