<p>It is used to choose the date of a substitute holiday in the <a href="Catalog.BusinessCalendars.Form.ItemForm/Help">business calendar</a>.</p>
<p>The application includes a national business calendar with government-approved information on workdays, holidays, and substitute holidays.</p>
<p>However sometimes you need to temporarily fill in the data yourself (usually at the beginning of the year). It makes sense if you need the calendar data, but officially it has not yet been approved and the application does not have it, because the government has not approved all substitute holidays. You can fill the substitute holidays earlier, and then, when the data of the national calendar is approved and included in the application delivery, the substitute holidays will be automatically adjusted.</p>
<p>To open it, click <strong>Move day</strong> in the business calendar.</p>
<p>Select the date of a substitute holiday, click <strong>OK</strong> </p></body></html>
