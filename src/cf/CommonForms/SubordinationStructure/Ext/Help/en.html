<p>This report is used to display parent and subordinate application objects. </p>
<p>It is generated by the <strong>Related documents</strong> command on the navigation panel of the applied objects.</p>
<p>The report provides quick and visual access to the entire chain of documents and lists related from the viewpoint of business logic. Applied objects are considered related if one object refers to another. Correlation of objects looks as follows: in one applied object (child) another object (parent) is set as an attribute. The report allows you to see the whole chain of related objects from one applied object.</p>
<p>All children and parent objects of the current applied object are displayed in the report. The correlation of these objects is displayed in a visual form.</p>
<p>The application object for which the report is generated is displayed in bold. Parent objects tree is generated up and to the right of the object for which the report is generated. Child objects tree is generated down and to the right of the object for which the report is generated.</p>
