<p>Designed to select a business process performer (for example, <a href="BusinessProcess.Job.Form.BusinessProcessForm/Help">Job</a>).</p>
<p>Opened from the business process by clicking the selection button in the <strong>Performer</strong> field. </p>
<p>Depending on the specifics of business processes, <a href="Task.PerformerTask/Help">tasks</a> can be addressed to a performer or to a group of performers both personally (personal addressing; you can select a specific user as a performer), and, for some <a href="v8help://1cv8/EnterprWorkingWithBusinessProcesses_StandardInterface">business processes</a>, using business process roles (role addressing).</p>
<p>If you select a performer, the business process will be assigned to this performer. If you select a role as performed, the business process will be assigned to a user currently <a href="InformationRegister.TaskPerformers/Help"></a>performing this role. <br>Roles can be reassigned at a later time. In this case, the task will be automatically reassigned to new performers.</p>
<h3>Users</h3>
<ul><a name="СтандартныеПодсистемы.Пользователи">
<li>Select the required <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">user</a> and click <strong>Select</strong>.</li></a>. 
<li>You can also double-click the item.</li></ul><h3>Peculiarities of interaction with external users</h3>
<ul><li>
<div>External users can be performers of some business processes (for example, partners or contact persons of partners).</div>
</li><li>
<div>As a rule, external users cannot use the names of specific employees of a company, thus, they can only specify the performer roles assigned to them.</div>
</li><li>
<div>To do that, you need to configure a list of such roles, specifying that they are designed for certain categories of external users.</div></li></ul><h3>Performer roles</h3>
<ul><li>
<div>In case of role addressing, assignment is not issued to the performer, but to a certain role of the business process (for example, <strong>Room supervisor</strong>). </div>
<ul><li>
<div>Specifying, main, and additional <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.TaskAddressingObjects/Help">addressing objects</a> can be used. For example, the <strong>Project manager</strong> role can have the main <strong>Department</strong> addressing object and additional <strong>Project</strong> object. </div>
</li><li>
<div>Thus, addressing objects help to clarify to which project managers and in which department the task is assigned.</div></li></ul></li><li>
<div>Select a performer role and click <strong>Select</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>You can also double-click the item.</div>
</li><li>
<div>If necessary, select the addressing object. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</div></li></ul><h3>See also: </h3>
