<p>Security profiles - the1C:Enterprise 8.3 platform mechanism that allows to control how the infobases use external (relative to 1C:Enterprise server clusters) resources, such as file system directories, COM objects (for Windows-based systems), and external (relative to application) software modules based on 1C:Enterprise scripts, such as external reports and data processors, <strong>Execute</strong> and <strong>Evaluate</strong> method calls, add-ins, operating system applications, and online resources. Security profiles can be used to isolate any infobase and to block it from using any external resources not permitted by administrator explicitly.</p>
<p>Prevous versions of the platform required full access to external reports and data processors to be allowed in the security profiles. In the latest version, this limitation was removed, making it possible to specify stricter external resource use permissions for external code (including code for external reports and data processors) than for infobases.</p>
<p>Now permissions to access external (relative to 1C:Enterprise server cluster) resources are managed automatically. Thus, the administrator does not have to keep track of external resources, to which access must be granted for the application to be able to function, but receives a dialog box containing the <a href="DataProcessor.ExternalResourcePermissionSetup.Form.ExternalResourcePermissionSetup/Help">list of requested permissions</a>. If the requested permissions are approved by the administrator, they will be added to the security profile in server cluster automatically. The security profiles generated for applications are as strict as possible (for example, the Full access to external reports and data processors check box is cleared by default).</p>
<p>When working with thin client under Linux, it is necessary to install RAS administration server in order to enable automated permissions management for security profiles. When working under Windows, two options of settings are available: either using a RAS administration server, or a COM-based connection.</p>
<p>To switch to automated permissions management, change the value in <a href="DataProcessor.ExternalResourcePermissionSetup.Form.SecurityProfileSetup/Help">settings</a> to <strong>Security profiles use mode</strong> in the <strong>Administration - Support and service - Security</strong> section.</p>
<p>Security profiles are only available to owners of CORP client and server licenses for 1C:Enterprise 8 platform.</p></body></html>
