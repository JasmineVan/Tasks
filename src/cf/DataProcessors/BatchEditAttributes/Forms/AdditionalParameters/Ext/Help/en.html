<p>After the <a href="DataProcessor.BatchEditAttributes/Help">attributes change</a> value is entered, you can customize the settings by using the <strong>Additional parameters</strong> command:</p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Change in transaction</strong> (the check box is selected by default) – the program allows processing the elements of the list in transaction selected to be changed. If any of the objects fails to be recorded while the check box is selected (for instance, due to it being edited by another user), changes in non of the objects will be saved.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Abort on error</strong> - it is recommended that you select this check box if changes of objects are performed outside the transaction; the check box is set by default. In this case, if it is impossible to record an object, the program displays a warning and offers either to continue changing the rest of the objects or to abort processing to establish problems. If the check box is not marked and the object cannot be recorded, the problem skips it and changes other objects.</div>
</li><li>
<div>
<p><strong>Process subsidiary elements</strong> - this check box is not selected by default; it allows to alter subsidiary elements of selected groups and parent objects without having to select all check boxes of all elements of groups and subsidiary objects. If the check box is not selected, the program, processes the group itself, not its subsidiary elements. </p></div></li></ul><h3>Additional parameters for an administrator</h3>
<p>There is an additional parameter for an administrator, which you can manage by executing the <strong>Group attributes change</strong> command in the <strong>Administration - Support and service</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Special features</strong> - by default, in the <strong>Group objects change</strong> window, the list of available attributes does not include the ones which are not recommended to alter. To view them, click <img src="CommonPicture.RightArrow"></img>. Since editing service attributes can affect performance of the program, it is recommended to use these features with caution and only for maintenance. The following parameters are available:</div>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Show service attributes</strong> - mark this check box to display the attributes that are not recommended to alter;</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Developer mode</strong> - Execute record of objects in the <strong>Data.Exchange.Load = True</strong> mode;</div>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Disconnect filters on selecting values</strong> - when selecting values, this parameter allows not to use filters written in properties of the <strong>ChoiceParameterLinks</strong> and <strong>ChoiceParameters</strong> attributes.</p></li></ul></li><li>
<div><strong>Process subsidiary elements</strong> parameter is unavailable in this mode.</div></li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
