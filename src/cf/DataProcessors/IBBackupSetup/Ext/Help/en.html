<p>Designed to configure infobase backup.</p>
<p>Sometimes data loss may occur, for example, due to power failures, computer failures, or incorrect actions in the application. To reduce risks of data loss, the application administrator must regularly back up infobase. Only in this case you can restore the infobase. The frequency of creating backups depends on the intensity of new data entry into the application. It is also recommended that you crate backups before any operations in the application that can change large amounts of data, for example, before bulk editing objects.</p>
<p><a href="DataProcessor.IBBackup.Form.RestoreDataFromBackup/Help">Data can be restored</a> from a previously created backup file at any time. Please consider that the recovered infobase contains only data that was entered at the time of <a href="DataProcessor.IBBackup.Form.DataBackup/Help">creating a backup</a>. Data entered after the backup will be permanently lost. Thus, it is important to create a backup schedule to minimize data loss.</p>
<p>The use of backup in 1C:Enterprise mode is available only for file mode. It is recommended that you use DBMS tools in client/server mode. For more information, see 1C: Enterprise 8.2. Client/server mode. Administrator Guide.</p>
<p>You can open it by clicking a corresponding link in the warning that is displayed on launching the application if backup is not configured. This warning offers you to configure infobase backup. If you ignore the warning about backup setting, it will be displayed every hour.</p>
<p>You can also click <strong>Backup setting</strong> in the <strong>Administration - Service - Backup and restoring</strong> section. Under this command, you can see information about backup status in the application.</p>
<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Warning!</strong> Backup is not supported if the <strong>Administrator</strong> user on whose behalf the backup is running has operating system authentication.</li></ul><h3>Backup setting (file mode)</h3>
<ul><li>
<p>The application allows you to create backups in the 1C:Enterprise mode. Backup can be performed automatically or manually. To perform backup automatically, configure it. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the <strong>Run automatic backup</strong> check box. </p>
</li><li>After that, you can select the following options using the radio button: 
<ul><li><strong>Regularly on schedule</strong>. Backup is performed automatically. Follow the link to set up backup <a href="v8help://mngbase/jobschedule.lf">schedule</a>. The link shows the entered schedule. Unavailable in basic versions. 
<ul><li>When creating a schedule, make sure that the application operates at the time the backup starts. Otherwise backup will not be performed. 
</li><li><strong>Warning!</strong> Some standard settings in the backup schedule are not supported: <strong>Repeat after pause</strong>, <strong>Terminate at</strong>, <strong>Stop in</strong>. Select other settings in order to replace them.</li></ul></li><li><strong>On exiting</strong>. On exiting the application, administrator is asked to perform a backup. To start backup when exiting the application, confirm you choice by clicking <strong>Exit</strong>. The <strong>Backup execute</strong> check box in the <strong>Exit application</strong> window is selected by default. Clear the check box if you do not want to be prompted to back up data on exiting the application. </li></ul></li><li>Select the <strong>Directory for backup saving</strong>. To do this, click <img src="StdPicture.InputFieldSelect"></img><strong>Select</strong>, specify the path to the folder where backups are placed to, for example, <strong>E:\Backup</strong>. The field is required. It is recommended that you back up to another computer or an external storage media. 
</li><li>Using the radio button, select a period during which the application will <strong>Store backups</strong>, or the number of stored backups: 
<ul><li><strong>All</strong>. You can select this option if storage capacity of your hard drive with backup directory is enough to store backup files. 
</li><li><strong>Over the past 6 months</strong>. (by default). You can select the period of backups storage. 
</li><li><strong>Last 10 pcs</strong>. (by default). You can restrict the number of stored backups.</li></ul></li><li>Click <strong>Finish</strong> to confirm your choice and go back to the application. The application will switch to automatic backup mode.</li></ul><h3>Performing backup by third-party software</h3>
<ul><li>You can decline automatic backup setting if backup is performed by a third-party software, for example, by DBMS in client/server mode, or third-party backup software. 
</li><li>To do this, clear the <strong>Run automatic backup</strong> check box. </li></ul><h3>Backing up on file storing in volumes</h3>
<ul><li>If files are stored in volumes on a hard drive, back up these files by using other tools.</li></ul><h3>Backup errors</h3>
<p>If the backup failed, and there is the following entry in the temporary log file: "<strong>Exception in createConnection: Error, Automation server can't create object</strong>", then the 32-bit comcntr.dll component is most likely used on a PC running a 64-bit operating system. To fix this problem, take 64-bit comcntr.dll component from the 1C Enterprise x64 Server distribution, and register it by running from the command line:</p>
<p class="SourceCode">regsvr32 &lt;64-bit comcntr.dll location&gt;\comcntr.dll</p>
