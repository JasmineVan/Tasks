<p>Description of scheduled job's properties.</p>
<p>The need to change settings of scheduled jobs is seldom. You can deselect the <strong>Use</strong> check box to disable a scheduled job. </p>
<p>You can also set two separate schedules for one scheduled job and add a new scheduled task following one of the predefined templates of the application.</p>
<h3>Scheduled job properties</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Use</strong> flag allows to enable and disable a scheduled task. <br>This option is useful when you need to disable a scheduled task for a short time without changing the schedule. 
</li><li>You can set the <a href="v8help://mngbase/jobschedule.lf">scheduled job schedule</a> via the <strong>Schedule</strong> link.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Description</strong> property field provides description for a scheduled job. This property field is usually blank, and the synonym that is set in a scheduled job template in Designer mode is used instead of it. If the synonym of a template is not set, then its name is used. 
</li><li><strong>In case of errors, repeat __ times</strong> is used to indicate the number of attempts to run the scheduled job in case errors occur. 
<ul><li><strong>after __ seconds</strong> indicates a time gap (in seconds) between the attempts to run the scheduled job in case errors occur.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p>
<ul><li><strong>Predefined</strong> property field has either a <strong>Yes</strong> or a <strong>No</strong> value. Non-predefined (manually set) scheduled jobs are rarely used. 
</li><li><strong>ID</strong> property field is to be used only by an experienced administrator able to use 1C:Enterprise language. It helps to investigate abnormal problems of scheduled jobs operation when they occur. 
</li><li><strong>Key value</strong> property field is to be used only by an experienced administrator able to use 1C:Enterprise language. It is required for fine-tuning execution of scheduled jobs and investigating problems in their execution when they occur. If key value is set, before running a <a href="DataProcessor.ScheduledAndBackgroundJobs.Form.BackgroundJob/Help">background job</a>, the application checks if there is no other active one with the same scheduled job template as the current background job. 
</li><li><strong>Username</strong> is a name of an infobase <a href="Catalog.Users.Form.ItemForm/Help">user</a> that will be used for the execution of a scheduled job. Accessible from the <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">Users</a> list.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Name</strong> is a template name for a scheduled job set in the Designer mode. 
</li><li><strong>Synonym</strong> is a synonym of a scheduled job template set in the Designer mode. 
</li><li><strong>Method name</strong> is a name of a procedure in a configuration that will be run in a scheduled job created following the scheduled job schedule.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Message</strong> field is used for warning messages and error details if they occur during the latest execution of a background job created within the scheduled job.
