<p>This form is used to administrate scheduled and background jobs.</p>
<p>A number of actions in the application can be executed automatically in background mode, on a specific schedule. Such actions are scheduled jobs. For example, it is daily currency rates import, regular report mailing, and deferred document posting. Scheduled jobs allow you to perform routine tasks in the application, and at the same time reduce the human factor (for example, you can forget to import currency rates).</p>
<p>To open this list, in section <strong>Administration - Service - Scheduled operations</strong>, click <strong>Scheduled and background jobs</strong>.</p>
