<p>Designed to create infobase backup.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you create backups before any operation in the application that can irreversibly change large amounts of data, for example, before bulk editing application object attributes. In this case, you should back up data manually.</p>
<p>It is accessible by clicking <strong>Create backup</strong> in the <strong>Administration - Service - Backup and restoring</strong> section.</p>
<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Warning!</strong> Backup is not supported if the <strong>Administrator</strong> user on whose behalf the backup is running has operating system authentication.</li></ul><h3>Backing up</h3>
<ul><li>At top of window, you can see the last time the backup was performed. 
</li><li>By clicking <img src="StdPicture.InputFieldSelect"></img><strong>Select</strong> in the <strong>Directory to save backup</strong> field (the field is required), specify a folder the application will save the infobase backup to. It is recommended that you back up to another computer or an external storage media. 
</li><li>If there are <a href="DataProcessor.ActiveUsers/Help">current sessions</a> in the application, the application displays a warning about it. Click the link to <strong>View list of active sessions</strong>. User work in the application should be <a href="DataProcessor.ApplicationLock/Help">completed</a>. 
</li><li>After setting the required parameters, click <strong>Save backup.</strong> </li></ul><h3>Backup procedure</h3>
<ul><li>The application attempts to back up at the moment. In the window, you can see a message showing <strong>Getting ready to create a backup</strong> and the <strong>Active users</strong> link. Click the link to view a list of connections to the application. The application attempts to terminate all user sessions. 
</li><li>After all user sessions are terminated, the application locks out and runs backup. 
</li><li>If the application cannot terminate all user sessions, it offers you to perform a backup while users are connected to the application. You can agree with the application offer if administrator is sure that connected users do not enter data to the application (for example, a user forgot to exit the application at the end of the day). Otherwise user sessions should be terminated locally. 
</li><li>After the backup is successful completed, the application starts again. You can see a message about performed backup indicating the path to the backup file. 
</li><li>If the application cannot forcibly terminate sessions, and administrator does not take any actions, backup might not be performed. In this case, the application displays a warning that backup cannot be performed, and a list of sessions that cannot be terminated (for example, Designer).</li></ul><p></p>
<h3>Starting application if errors occurred during backup</h3>
<ul><li>Before backup, the application displays a message with recommendations for immediate start.
