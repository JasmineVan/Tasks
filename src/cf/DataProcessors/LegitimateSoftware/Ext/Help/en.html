<p>It is designed to check whether updates are received legally.</p>
<p>When updating, the application asks the administrator to confirm that the update files were received legally. </p>
<p>Select an option by using the radio button:</p>
<ul><li><strong>I confirm the legality of receiving updates in accordance with the abovementioned conditions</strong>. In this case the application will be updated. 
</li><li><strong>I DO NOT confirm the legality of receiving updates in accordance with the abovementioned conditions</strong>. In this case the application will be shut down.</li></ul><p>The <strong>Terms and conditions of update distribution of the "1C:Enterprise" applications</strong> are given, in the text of which useful information and links are placed: about contract for ITS, software support, and 1C partners.</p>
<p>The <strong>Allow sending application usage data to 1C automatically</strong> check box is selected by default. In this case 1C will automatically receive reports on usage of the application. Collected info is depersonalized and contains only statistics.</p>
<p>Preparation and submission of reports will not slow down the program, while reports on the use of the program will help developers determine what needs additional work. That is why we do not recommend clearing the check box.</p></body></html>
