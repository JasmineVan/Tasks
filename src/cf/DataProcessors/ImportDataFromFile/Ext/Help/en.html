<p>Allows you to import tabular data from files into arbitrary lists and tabular sections of documents. For example, for a one-time transfer of master data upon migrating from other applications, or to regularly export data into tabular sections upon filling documents.</p>
<h3>Benefits of importing data from file</h3>
<ul><li>Allows you to use other applications to enter data (for example, you can enter data into Microsoft Excel, and then import it into the application). 
</li><li>You do not need to have 1C:Enterprise application installed on your computer to enter data into the file, i.e. data can be entered into such file from remote offices, small warehouses, or retail outlets, i.e. the locations where 1C:Enterprise application may not function correctly (for example, the computer is already outdated for this application). 
</li><li>Allows you to involve additional staff in data entry. Entering data into an external file only requires adhering to the table structure as well as following the input rules in the application, for which it is intended. For example, Microsoft Excel can be assigned to employees with basic computer skills. </li></ul><p> </p></body></html>
