<p>This list is used to configure additional property sets.</p>
<p>You can configure additional property sets for particular application objects. </p>
<p>A storage method of an additional property in the application and its location in the application object window depend on the property type: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Additional attributes</strong> are stored in a catalog item or document (can be placed in a dedicated section or tab). They are created to implement properties that are considered to be an integral part of the object. They are filled in upon editing the object and are available for editing to users who have an access to the object with properties. 
</li><li><strong>Additional info</strong> is used to store information on a catalog item or document that are not its integral part. Generally, it is available for viewing and editing to users who have no access to the object itself. It is edited in a dedicated window accessible from the object window.</li></ul><p>Additional attributes and info can be used in different combinations for different application objects: either additional attributes and info or additional attributes or additional info.</p>
<p>To be able to use additional properties, select the <strong>Additional attributes and info</strong> check box in <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong>. After that, appropriate commands become available.</p>
<p>You can work with additional attributes or information in the lists that are open by the <strong>Additional attributes</strong> or <strong>Additional information</strong> in <strong>Administration-Common settings</strong>. </p>
<p>You can also open the list of additional attribute sets from application objects, for which they are set. To do this, click <strong>More actions</strong> - <strong>Change set of additional attributes</strong>. </p>
<p>You can also open the list of additional info sets by clicking <strong>More actions</strong> - <strong>Change set of additional</strong><strong> info</strong> from the <a href="CommonForm.AdditionalDataEditing/Help">Additional info</a> window of an application object.</p>
<p>The <strong>Additional attributes</strong> or <strong>Additional info</strong> list is a table consisting of two sections: </p>
<ul><li>The left section contains sets of additional attributes and info assigned to catalogs or documents displayed as groups. Groups in additional attribute and info sets correspond to a particular object status (its kind). For example, for products, sets by names correspond to product kinds. 
</li><li>The right section contains a list of additional attributes or info included in the selected set. The list is displayed as a table. Required attributes in the list of additional attributes are displayed in bold. This feature is unavailable for additional info. 
</li><li>In the table, you can see the following: 
<ul><li><strong>Additional attribute</strong> or <strong>Additional info</strong> includes a list of additional attributes or info descriptions. 
</li><li><strong>Value type</strong> shows the type of additional attributes or info and the number of values.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Predefined sets of additional attributes and information match the application objects (lists or documents) where additional attributes and information can be used. You cannot add new sets in this list. Sets are created automatically when you create groups in lists. </p>
<p>In the application, you can create a set of additional attributes and info both for all catalog items and for specific catalog items. In this case, a catalog is considered as a group, and catalog attributes or catalog attributes values are considered as group items (the number of group items is equal to the number of attributes values).</p>
<h3>Assigning new additional attributes or info to catalogs or documents</h3>
<ul><li>Depending on settings, one of the following commands for entering new attributes or info is available: 
<ul><li>Select a set matching this catalog or document, and then click <strong>Create</strong>. By default, an additional attribute or info can be added only to one set. Fill in the required <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalAttributesAndInfo.Form.ItemForm/Help">fields</a>. 
</li><li>Select a set matching this catalog or document, and then click <strong>Add - <strong>New</strong></strong>. It is similar to the <strong>Create</strong> command. Using this command, an additional attribute or info can be added only to one set. Fill in the required fields.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Common additional attribute and info sets</h3>
<ul><li>Predefined <strong>Common</strong> sets are available for some catalogs. By default, additional attributes and info included in this set become common for all items of these catalogs. 
</li><li>
<div>Select the <strong>Common</strong> set. </div>
</li><li>
<div>Click <strong>Create</strong> or <strong>Add - <strong>New</strong></strong>. Fill in the required fields.</div></li></ul><h3>Adding additional attributes or info from another set</h3>
<ul><li>In the application, you can use previously entered additional attributes and info for other sets. 
</li><li>This method is most useful for additional attributes and info of the <strong>Additional value</strong> and <strong>Additional value (hierarchy)</strong> types. If appropriate settings are made (at least one of the check boxes in the <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong> section is selected), the <strong>Add</strong> button becomes available. 
</li><li>Select an additional attribute or info set, click <strong>Add</strong>, and in the drop-down list, click <strong>From other set</strong>. 
</li><li>Wizard of adding an additional attribute or info opens. 
<ul><li>In the left part of the first wizard page, you can see the list of previously entered attributes or info. In the right part, values and other parameters of the selected attribute are displayed.</li></ul></li><li>Select an additional attribute or info on the first wizard page. Note that you cannot create an additional attribute or info in this list. 
<ul><li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to choose an option of adding an additional attribute or info. 
</li><li>You can also add an attribute from one set to another one by dragging it. If appropriate settings are made, the second page of the <strong>Add additional attribute or info</strong> wizard opens.</li></ul></li><li>On the second wizard page, using the radio button, choose an option of adding an additional attribute or info: 
<ul><li><a href="#1">Copy attribute</a> to create the same attribute or info in the new set. 
</li><li><a href="#2">Copy attribute by sample</a> to create an additional attribute or info with a common value list. The <strong>Attributes and info with common value list</strong> check box in the <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong> section is to be selected. 
</li><li><a href="#3">Add common attribute to set</a> to make an additional attribute or info common. In this case, not the value list becomes common but the attribute itself. The <strong>Common attributes and info</strong> check box in the <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong> section is to be selected.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a name="1">Copying additional attributes or info</a></h3>
<ul><li>In the application, you can copy additional attributes or info. 
</li><li>In this case, a copy is created for a set of additional attributes or info. This copy is an independent additional attribute or info with its own value list, and it is not linked with the original based on which it is created. 
</li><li>Depending on settings, there are several options: 
<ul><li>In the wizard of adding new additional attributes and info. 
<ul><li>Select a set of additional attributes in the list, and then click <strong>Add - From other set</strong>. 
</li><li>On the first wizard page, select an attribute to copy in the attribute list, and then click <strong>Next</strong>. 
</li><li>On the second wizard page, using the radio button, select <strong>Copy attribute</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>. 
</li><li>Fill in the rest of fields. After you copy the attribute, the value list is available for editing.</li></ul></li><li>By dragging. 
<ul><li>You can drag an additional attribute or info from one set to another one. 
</li><li>If a list contains the <strong>Add</strong> button, the second page of the Add additional attribute or info wizard opens. 
</li><li>If a list contains only the <strong>Create</strong> button, the card of the additional attribute or info to copy opens. Fill in the rest of fields.</li></ul></li><li>By clicking <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong>. 
<ul><li>Select an additional attribute or info, and then click <strong>Copy</strong>. Select a set to which you want to add this additional attribute or info. Click <strong>Paste</strong>. If appropriate settings are made, the second page of the Add additional attribute or info wizard opens. If the selected additional attribute or info is already included in a set, the application suggests that you make it common. 
</li><li>The <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong> commands are also available in the context menu, which opens by right-clicking an attribute, or in the <strong>More actions</strong> menu.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3><a name="2">Adding additional attributes or info by sample</a></h3>
<ul><li>To be able to use this option, select the <strong>Attributes and info with common value list</strong> check box in <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong>. 
</li><li>You can use previously entered attributes and info from other sets and add attributes with a common value list for several attributes of the same type (for example, the <strong>Door color</strong> attribute by sample of the <strong>Color</strong> attribute). In this case, a value list of the sample attribute is used. It is convenient to configure a value list for several attributes of the same type at once. 
</li><li>
<div>Select a set from the list.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Click <strong>Add - From other set</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>The list of all additional attributes or info already existing in the application opens. Select an additional attribute or info from this <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalAttributesAndInfo.Form.ChoiceForm/Help">list</a> and click <strong>Next</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>
<div>Using the radio button, select <strong>Copy attribute by sample</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</div></div>
</li><li>
<div>Type and all values of the selected additional attribute or info will be copied to the new item. </div>
</li><li>
<div>Fill in all required fields. By default, the attribute becomes common to the source set. In this case, you cannot enter new values. You will see a message informing you that the value list is common to another attribute.</div>
</li><li>
<div>After the additional attribute or info is saved, using the link, you can view the sample attribute and add values if necessary.</div></li></ul><h3><a name="3">Adding common additional attributes or info</a></h3>
<ul><li>A common attribute is included in multiple sets. This option is suitable when not only a value list but also the attribute itself is to be common. In lists and reports on catalog and document items, common attributes are grouped and shown as a single attribute in one column or field. For example, using common attribute <strong>Color</strong>, you can filter all yellow clothes and shoes. 
</li><li>To be able to use this option, select the <strong>Additional attributes and info</strong> check box in <strong>Administration - Common settings</strong>. 
</li><li>
<div>To add a common additional attribute or info to a set, select the set, and then click <strong>Add - From other set</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Select a common additional attribute or information from the suggested <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.AdditionalAttributesAndInfo.Form.ChoiceForm/Help">list</a>. Select <strong>Next</strong>. </div>
</li><li>The second wizard page opens. Using the radio button, select <strong>Make attribute common and add it to set</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>. The common additional attribute opens. 
</li><li>
<div>You can also add a common additional attribute or info by dragging it or by clicking <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>To add a common attribute to multiple sets, repeat these actions for each set.</div></li></ul><h3>Specifics of deleting additional attributes or info</h3>
<ul dir="ltr"><li>
<div>To delete a common additional attribute or info, delete it from each set to which it is included. It might be necessary to clear values of additional attributes for complete deletion.</div>
</li><li>
<div>If a property is marked for deletion from a set, property values are stored in objects until they are cleared. A property marked for deletion from a set is displayed in the object window or additional info window in a particular way.</div>
</li><li>
<div>You can clear deletion marks if necessary.</div></li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
