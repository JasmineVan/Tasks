<p>The list is located on the application desktop and designed to work with notes. </p>
<p>You can keep notes in the application. Notes are arbitrary text information, for which it is impossible to find any suitable catalog or document, and no one else could have access to it. Notes are available only to their author.</p>
<p>Notes cannot contain information, for which the application provides the appropriate lists or documents. </p>
<p>Notes can be marked with color. </p>
<p>Some notes (the most important, not marked for deletion, that have the <strong>Show on desktop</strong> check box selected) can be displayed in this list. </p>
<p>A part of notes in the list is entered in relation to applied objects. Navigation panel of such objects has the <strong>My notes</strong> command to view the <a href="Catalog.Notes.Form.SubjectNotes/Help">list of notes</a> related to them. In lists such objects are marked with the <img src="CommonPicture.Note"></img> sign. In this case, the <strong>Subject</strong> field of a note is populated with a reference to applied object.</p>
