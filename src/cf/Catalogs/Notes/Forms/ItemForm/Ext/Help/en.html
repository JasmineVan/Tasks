<p>You can put to the note an arbitrary text information, for which it is impossible to find any suitable catalog or document, and no one else could have access to it.</p>
<p>Notes are available in the <a href="Catalog.Notes.Form.SubjectNotes/Help">card of applied objects</a> or on the <a href="Catalog.Notes.Form.MyNotes/Help">desktop</a>, that is why you can quickly and for the short time write some information and then move it to a more suitable catalog. For example, you can use a note as a temporary place to quickly record an address during a phone conversation with a client, in order to then move this address to the <strong>Counterparties</strong> catalog without being in a hurry. </p>
<p>You can also use notes to store information that stays relevant for a long period of time (for example, you can use notes as a notebook in which you can record a birthday of a coworker or a customer who is important for you, and you can enter a reminder about this note not to forget to wish them a happy birthday).</p>
<p>You can mark notes with color, put them on the desktop, and combine into groups. </p>
<h3>Entering a note</h3>
<ul><li>When entering a note about any applied object, it is automatically populated with <strong>Subject</strong> - reference, by which you can open this object. 
</li><li>When you enter a note in the <strong>My Notes</strong> list on the application desktop or in the <a href="Catalog.Notes.Form.AllNotes/Help">All Notes</a> list, the <strong>Subject</strong> field is populated with "not specified". 
</li><li>Write a note text. There are standard formatting commands to edit a note text. Some of them that are frequently used, are displayed in the form of buttons for convenience. For the rest of them right-click to see the context menu or go to the <strong>More</strong> menu. 
</li><li>You can arrange a note text in two ways: 
<ul><li>
<div>You can enter almost all text not highlighting the title, then almost all text will be displayed in note lists.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Or you can enter a short title in the first note row, and this text will be displayed in note lists. Then press <strong>Enter</strong> and enter the rest of the text.</div></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>The most important notes can be displayed in the <strong>My notes</strong> list on the application desktop. Select the <strong>Show on desktop</strong> check box. (It is selected by default). 
</li><li>
<div>In order to distinguish notes, you can mark them with icons of different colors. You can sort them by color in the <strong>All notes</strong> list. Select <strong>Color</strong>. </div>
</li><li>
<div>You can group notes, for example, by subjects. Select <strong>Notes group</strong> from the list by clicking <strong>Show all</strong>. You can enter a new group in the <a href="Catalog.Notes.Form.FolderForm/Help">list of groups</a>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>The bottom of the note displays the note recording status. If a note has not been saved yet, the field has the <strong>Not written</strong> value. The application populates the <strong>Written</strong> field with date and time of the last note saving.</div></li></ul><h3>Reminder</h3>
<ul><li>
<div>In order not to forget about the event mentioned in the note, click <img src="CommonPicture.Reminder"></img> - <strong>Remind</strong>. Enter a <a href="InformationRegister.UserReminders.Form.Reminder/Help">reminder</a> to a note.</div></li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
