<p>It is designed to manage notes.</p>
<p>The <strong>Notes</strong> list belongs to internal data for the administrator. It is useful for controlling all notes in the application entered by all its <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">users</a>. </p>
<p>To work with your notes and enter them, use the <a href="Catalog.Notes.Form.AllNotes/Help">All notes</a> or <a href="Catalog.Notes.Form.MyNotes/Help">My notes</a> lists on the desktop. <a href="Catalog.Notes.Form.FolderForm/Help">Groups</a> entered in the <strong>All notes</strong> list are also displayed in this list. </p>
<p>You can keep notes in the application. Notes are arbitrary text information, for which it is impossible to find any suitable catalog or document, and no one else could have access to it. Notes, as well as reminders, are good as digital replacement of "stickers on the edges of the monitor". </p>
<p>Using <a href="Catalog.Notes.Form.ItemForm/Help">note</a>, you can quickly write down some information for a short time, and then move it to a more suitable catalog (for example, you can use the note as a temporary place to quickly record the address during a telephone conversation with a client, in order to then slowly move this address to the <strong>Counterparties</strong> directory). You can also use notes to store information that is relevant for a long time (for example, as a notebook to which you can record the birthday of a client who is important for you).</p>
<p>You can mark notes with color, put them on the desktop, and combine into groups. Notes are available only to their author.</p>
<p>Notes can be entered both <a href="Catalog.Notes.Form.SubjectNotes/Help">with reference to</a> any application data (for example, you can create notes by a certain partner, goods movement document, and so on) and independently (for example, you can use them as a notebook).</p>
<p>Notes cannot contain information, for which the application provides the appropriate catalogs or documents. For example, it is not recommended to place into notes contact information, information about tasks, and so on.</p>
<p>The list includes the following columns:</p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Subject</strong> - a note title.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Author</strong>- a user who created the note.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Subject</strong> - full description of a subject, for which a note is created.</div>

</li><li>
