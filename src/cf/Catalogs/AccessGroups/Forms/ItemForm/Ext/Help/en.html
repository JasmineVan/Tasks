<p>Details of access group properties.</p>
<p>An access group defines a set of actions with the application data the members of this group are allowed to perform. Generally, <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.ListForm/Help">access groups</a> correspond to user job functions or duties. A user can be a member of multiple access groups at the same time, these groups collectively defining their personal access rights settings.</p>
<p>Access groups can be used to create and modify common access rights settings for a group of users performing similar activities in the application, for example, <strong>Accountants</strong>.</p>
<p>You need the administrator rights to manage the access. A user responsible for an access group can <a href="#1">change the group's content</a> on the <strong>Members</strong> tab.</p>
<p>An access group is always linked to an <a href="Catalog.AccessGroupProfiles/Help">access group profile</a> commonly incorporating multiple roles. Once a user is added to an access group, they are automatically assigned all roles listed in the access group profiles. For example, a predefined access group <strong>Administrators</strong> is linked to the <strong>Administrator</strong> profile incorporating the <strong>Full rights</strong> role. This role grants unlimited access to all data; it is assigned to all application administrators belonging to the <strong>Administrators</strong> access group.</p>
<h3>Creating access groups</h3>
<p>To create an access group, you need to select a profile (we recommend that you start from this point), specify group member list, and define any access restrictions.</p>
<ul><li>Select <strong>Profile</strong>. It determines available rights (according to its role list) and available rights restrictions broken down by access kind: for example, restrictions related to <strong>Companies</strong>, <strong>Warehouses</strong>, etc. Any access kinds found in the profile will be added to the access group automatically. 
</li><li>Enter access group <strong>Name</strong> that should reflect its purpose and restrictions by access kind (<a href="Catalog.AccessGroups/Help">for more information, see access group description</a>). 
<ul><li>We recommend that you choose a plural name containing the profile name (as displayed in the <strong>Profile</strong> field) and clearly describing the access right settings assigned to this access group. For example, you can create access groups named <strong>Sales managers in Forward Thinking Inc.</strong> and <strong>Sales managers in New Tech LLC</strong> on the basis of the <strong>Sales managers </strong>profile.</li></ul></li><li>You can add access group to an access group <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.FolderForm/Help">folder</a>. 
<ul><li>Select a folder from the <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.FolderChoiceForm/Help">list</a> in the <strong>Group (folder)</strong> field.</li></ul></li><li>Allowed participants of the access group are defined in the profile in accordance with the selected assignment. 
<ul><li>Depending on the profile settings, the access group may include different types of users: <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">users</a> and <a href="Catalog.UserGroups/Help">user groups</a>. You can also add <a href="Catalog.ExternalUsers/Help">external users</a> an<a href="Catalog.ExternalUsersGroups/Help">d external user groups</a> to the access group (this may be useful for polls purposes, etc). </li></ul></li><li>On the <a href="#1">Participants tab</a>, fill in the list of participants of the access group, indicate the person responsible for the access group. 
</li><li>Go to the <a href="#2">Access restrictions</a> tab and enter additional access rights settings. 
</li><li>You can also enter detailed information on the access group on the <strong>Commentary</strong> tab.</li></ul><h3>Group <a name="1">participants</a></h3>
<ul><li>
<div>Enumerate the list of users (and user groups) to which access rights settings should apply. Lists from which you can select group participants are listed in the <strong>Allowed participants</strong> field at the bottom of the tab. </div>
<ul><li>
<div>To add multiple users, click <strong>Pick</strong>; to add a single user, click <strong>More - Add</strong>. Select the required access group members from list. </div>
</li><li>
<div>To delete one or several access group participants, select them and click <strong>Delete</strong>.</div></li></ul></li><li>
<div>Fill in the <strong>Person responsible</strong> field by selecting a user from the <strong>Users</strong> list. The user assigned as a <strong>Person responsible</strong> for the group can change the list of group members. </div></li></ul><h3><a name="2">Access restrictions</a></h3>
<ul><li>On the <strong>Access restrictions</strong> tab, you need to enter additional access rights settings. Access restrictions can only be created on profile level. On access group level, access restrictions can only be elaborated, if allowed by the profile settings. In certain cases, profile-based access restrictions are complete and require no elaboration. In these cases, the <strong>Access restrictions</strong> tab will be disabled. 
</li><li>Content of the access kind list on this tab depends on the profile specified in the <strong>Profile</strong> field. In addition, the profile also determines how the access kind setting works: it only allows viewing or it also includes the availability to edit data. For example, if the profile of access groups includes the role for reading the <strong>Demo: Goods receipt</strong>, users are allowed to view documents for the organizations specified. If the profile contains a role for adding and editing, then it becomes possible to edit such documents. 
</li><li>The <strong>Access kind</strong> field is used to precisely define the data area accessible to the access group members. Access kind is a some kind of rule that allows access to the application data. For example, using the <strong>Demo:</strong> <strong>Companies</strong> access kind, you can allow users to work only with documents on specific companies, or hide documents of some companies from them. 
</li><li>To set up the access restrictions, you need to specify a value list for each access kind. 
</li><li>
<div>To set the values, double-click the mouse (you can also execute the <strong>Edit</strong> command of the context menu by the right click of the mouse). Specify <strong>Access values</strong> for each <strong>Access kind</strong>. Two values are available:</div>
<ul><li><strong>All prohibited</strong>. In this case, access to all data is prohibited by default; you will need to explicitly specify any allowed values. We recommend that you use this method when you need to grant the users access to a specific limited data area. 
</li><li>
<div><strong>All allowed</strong>. In this case, access to all data is allowed by default; you will need to explicitly specify any prohibited values. The second setting method is convenient in cases when you need to lock access to a previously known data area, and to all new values entered into the program, the allowing rules should be applied by default. For example, if using the <strong>Demo:</strong> <strong>Companies</strong> access kind the right is set that prohibits to work with the documents by the Forward Thinking company, these restriction will not be applied to the new company New Tech, added to the application later. Please keep in mind that "allow" settings have priority over "prohibit" settings. So, if in the example above, the user is allowed to enter documents on the Forward Thinking company in some other access group with the same profile, then in the end the user will get access to all documents on this company</div></li></ul></li><li>
<div>You can specify a list of values or value groups to serve as exceptions for any <strong>Access kind</strong>, if necessary. For this, click <strong>Add</strong> in the <strong>Allowed (Prohibited) values</strong> list. Select exceptions from lists.</div>
<ul><li>In some cases, to simplify the setting of access rights, you can specify not individual elements, but the entire groups of elements in the list of allowed or prohibited values. For example, for the <strong>Demo: Partner groups</strong> access kind you can restrict the access in terms of partner access groups, not by each partner separately. For this, you will need to create the list of partner access groups, and assign each partner to a group. These activities are not limited to administrators; any user with sufficient rights to edit the partner list can perform this.</li></ul></li><li>For some access groups, the <strong>Users</strong> (or <strong>External users</strong>) access kind can be used for access rights setup. This applies only to the documents (and other application objects) containing fields that can be used to specify users allowed to access these documents (such as "Person responsible," "Author," and "Performer"). 
<ul><li>To grant group members access to all restricted data available to a specific user, you need to add this user to the allowed value list for the <strong>Users</strong> access kind. 
</li><li>For example, if access to the <strong>Receipt of goods and services</strong> documents depends on who is listed in the <strong>Person responsible</strong> field, then the user will be able to save documents for which the <strong>Person responsible</strong> is the same as the user, or added to the list of allowed for the <strong>Users</strong> type of access. The prohibiting setting acts in the same way.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
