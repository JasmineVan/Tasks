<p><a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.ListForm/Help">Access groups</a> are used to manage access rights and restrictions for specific users and user groups.</p>
<p>This method allows you to control user access to application functions, lists, and documents. A variety of predefined role sets is available in the application. Moreover, you can modify any access settings manually. Only administrator is allowed to manage user access settings. A user responsible for an <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.ItemForm/Help">access group</a> can change the group's content.</p>
<p>Access rights and restrictions are determined by the <a href="Catalog.AccessGroupProfiles/Help">access group profile</a>. </p>
<p>For example, you can create an access group named Sales managers of business software on the basis of the Sales managers profile, and add two users to this group. The profile supports access restrictions by the <strong>Product and service type</strong> access kind. Now, if you set all values for this access kind to Prohibited and add Business software to the product type list, both members of the access group will be only allowed access to application data and functionality related to business software.</p>
<p>We recommend that you give your access groups names that reflect the underlying profile's purpose and describe group-level restriction.</p>
<p>Both <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">single users</a> (<a href="Catalog.ExternalUsers/Help">external users</a>) and <a href="Catalog.UserGroups/Help">user groups</a> (<a href="Catalog.ExternalUsersGroups/Help">external user groups</a>) can belong to an access group. When working with large numbers of users belonging to multiple access groups, we recommend that you group these users for your convenience. Whenever possible, add user groups, instead of users, to access groups; this helps to minimize regular changes of user lists in multiple access groups.</p>
<h3>User role sets</h3>
<ul><li>User role sets are determined automatically, based on the <a href="Catalog.AccessGroups.Form.ListForm/Help">access group</a> the user belongs to (both explicitly and indirectly, via user groups). They are updated whenever lists of users belonging to access groups or <a href="Catalog.UserGroups/Help">user groups</a> (<a href="Catalog.ExternalUsersGroups.Form.ItemForm/Help">external user groups</a>) are modified. 
</li><li>It is not recommended that you change the user role components in any other way (for example, using the Designer), because in this case the role components will be restored at the next access group recording.</li></ul><h3>Merging access rights</h3>
<ul><li>User can belong to multiple access groups simultaneously. 
</li><li>In this case, their <a href="CommonForm.AccessRights/Help">access rights</a> granted by each access group are merged, according to logical disjunction. For example, let us consider a user belonging to the Acquisition managers group, which grants them access rights to view the Product receipt documents for Forward Thinking Inc. Membership in the Sales managers group also grants them rights to create the Customer order documents for New Tech LLC. 
</li><li>Please keep in mind that only access rights are merged as described above; the allowed value lists by group are not merged. Therefore, the user in the above example will not be granted access rights to view the Product receipt documents for New Tech LLC, or to create the Customer order documents for Forward Thinking Inc.</li></ul><h3>Administrators access group</h3>
<ul><li>A predefined access group named <strong>Administrators</strong> is available for administration purposes, based on the <strong>Administrator</strong> profile. Any user added to this group is automatically granted the <strong>Full rights</strong> role. If any user not belonging to the <strong>Administrators</strong> group was granted the <strong>Full rights</strong> role, the role will be revoked.</li></ul><h3>Warning</h3>
<ul><li>We recommend that you refrain from using 1C:Enterprise configuration mode for access rights setup purposes.</li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
