<p>Use this list to store external users (users working with the application "from outside"). Access rights of external users are usually strictly limited. External users do not actively participate in accounting, work independently, and do not intercommunicate. Examples of external users are: employees in an HR database, online store customers, and questionnaire responders.</p>
<p>You can open the list of external users from section <strong>Administration—Users and rights settings</strong>. Alternatively, you can open it from section <strong>Questionnaires</strong> (<strong>Access management</strong>).</p>
<p>External users are different from regular users, therefore, they are stored in separate application lists, for example, <strong>Counterparties</strong>, <strong>Individuals</strong>, and other lists.</p>
<p>Only administrators and external user list managers can edit the external user list. </p>
<p>Authorization of an external user requires administrator's approval.</p>
<p>External user list managers have the right to add external users and edit them (to a limited degree). They configure external users prior to their authorization approval by administrator. External user list managers can run the <strong>External access</strong> command, and also edit the <strong>External users</strong> and <strong>External user groups</strong> lists. </p>
<p>External users created by list managers are assigned the <strong>Requires approval</strong> status. Application administrators can filter users by this parameter, verify accuracy of the entered data, and allow authorization.</p>
<p>Once an administrator approves authorization for a user, list managers will be unable to change their authorization settings in any way, with the exception of revoking the authorization approval.</p>
<p>External users can view their personal data and edit personal parameters, such as password, application interface language, and contact information.</p>
<p>In a distributed infobase, authorization is configured for each infobase separately.</p>
<h3>Creating external users</h3>
<ul><li>The <img src="CommonPicture.UserState08"></img><strong>External access</strong> button located on the command bars of the application lists is a primary tool for creating and editing external users. The command creates an external user linked to the selected object, or displays details of an existing external user. 
</li><li>You can also create an <a href="Catalog.ExternalUsers.Form.ItemForm/Help">external user</a> directly in the external user list. Click <strong>Create</strong>, then specify the <strong>Object</strong> linked to the external user.</li></ul><h3>Filtering external users</h3>
<ul><li>
<div>You can filter the list by external user type (for instance, partners).</div>
</li><li>
<div>In the <strong>Type</strong> field, click the <img src="StdPicture.InputFieldSelect"></img> button to open the <a href="CommonForm.SelectUsersTypes/Help">selection window</a>, and then select the check marks for the external user types you want included in the list.</div></li></ul><h3>Viewing external users that belong to subgroups</h3>

<ul><li>If the application supports user groups, the list consists of two sections: the left one displays groups, and the right one displays the external user list. When you select a group, all external users belonging to this group are displayed in the right section. 
</li><li>Long lists of external users can be grouped for convenience (for instance, by user relation types, such as partners and contractors). 
</li><li>An external user can belong to multiple <a href="Catalog.ExternalUsersGroups/Help">groups</a>. 
</li><li>To add an external user to a group, you can use any of the following methods: 
<ul><li>When creating an external user, select a group from the list and click <strong>Create</strong>. 
</li><li>To add multiple external users to a group quickly, open the group window and click <strong>Select</strong>. The users will be selected from the <strong>External users</strong> <a href="#S">list</a> containing three sections.
