</li><li>Using the additional profiles, users can be given any auxiliary rights in addition to the main profile. 
<ul><li>For example, in addition to the <strong>Accountant</strong> and <strong>Warehouse supervisor</strong> main profiles, there are <strong>Counterparty communication</strong> and <strong>Unposted document printing</strong> profiles.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Recommendations on creating primary access group profiles</h3>
<ul style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr"><li>A primary profile should include a set of roles that grants all access rights required by users during their routine duties and operations, but does not provide them with excessive or unadvisable access to the application data or functionality. 
</li><li>Moreover, a primary profile should include additional roles not directly related to the user duties but yet necessary to perform these duties. 
</li><li>For example, the following roles must be included in the profile intended for document entry operators, besides the roles allowing to create and edit these documents: 
<ul><li>A role granting the right to sign in using the thin client, the thick client, or the web client. 
</li><li>the <strong>Basic rights</strong> and <strong>TM basic rights</strong> predefined roles, 
</li><li>roles allowing to view catalogs containing items selectable in the document fields; 
</li><li>roles allowing to view document processing reports, etc.</li></ul></li><li>For example, the <strong>Auditor</strong> profile should include the <strong>Read individuals</strong> primary role to allow viewing personal data on individuals, and a set of additional roles to support basic work functionality (such as <strong>Basic rights</strong>, <strong>Start thin client</strong>, etc).</li></ul><h3>Creating access group profiles</h3>
