<p>Use this window to prepare a <a href="Document.Questionnaire.Form.DocumentForm/Help">questionnaire</a> template.</p>
<p>Questionnaires are prepared in two stages. First, you need to prepare <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.QuestionsForSurvey/Help">questions</a> to be included in a questionnaire. Then you need to create a questionnaire template using the prepared questions. Later, this template will be used for automatic generation of a questionnaire when the respondent starts filling it in.</p>
<p>Specify the template <strong>Description</strong>. The <strong>Description</strong> field is displayed in the <a href="Catalog.QuestionnaireTemplates/Help">template list</a>.</p>
<p>A questionnaire template includes two tabs, namely <strong>Headers</strong> and <strong>Questions</strong>.</p>
<h3>Headers</h3>
<ul><li>Specify <strong>Header</strong> to be displayed in the questionnaire when it is being filled in by a respondent. 
</li><li>
<div>A questionnaire can include several sections but two sections, <strong>Introduction</strong> and <strong>Conclusion</strong>, are required and present in any questionnaire.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Write <strong>Introduction</strong>. In this section, you can welcome the respondent and explain how to fill in the questionnaire. The text will be shown to the respondent on starting the questionnaire.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Write <strong>Conclusion</strong>. In this section, you can thank the respondent for filling in the questionnaire. The text will be shown to the respondent on completing the questionnaire.</div></li></ul><h3>Questions</h3>
<ul><li>Any questionnaire includes at least one section with questions. 
</li><li>Generate a list of questionnaire questions. The questionnaire list includes the following columns: 
<ul><li><strong>Question</strong>, where the description of sections and questionnaire questions is displayed. 
</li><li><strong><img src="CommonPicture.ExclamationMarkGray"></img>Required</strong>, where <strong>Yes</strong> is displayed if the question has the <strong>Required</strong> check box selected. <strong>No</strong> is displayed if the check box is cleared. 
</li><li><strong><img src="CommonPicture.Comment" width="16" height="16"></img> Notes</strong>, where <img src="CommonPicture.Comment"></img> is displayed if additional information on the question is specified. To view the notes at the bottom of the list, select a question.</li></ul></li><li>Click <strong>Add</strong> to add a new item to the questionnaire (you can also right-click the context menu). Select <strong>Item type</strong>: 
<ul><li><strong>Section</strong> 
<ul><li>Specify <strong>Section name</strong>. In the <strong>Notes</strong> field, write clarifying information on the section to be displayed at the bottom of the template or the questionnaire. Add at least one section. To add a section, you can also press <strong>Ctrl+F9</strong>. </li></ul></li><li><a href="#1">Simple question</a> 
</li><li><a href="#2">Table question</a> 
</li><li><a href="#3">Question with condition</a>. </li></ul></li><li>
<div>If a questionnaire includes a large numbers of questions, it is recommended that you group the questions by several sections so that it is easier for the respondent to use the questionnaire. It is recommended that you add not more than 10–15 questions to a section for the best respondent experience.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Click <img src="StdPicture.MoveUp"></img><strong>Move up</strong> and <img src="StdPicture.MoveDown"></img><strong>Move down</strong> to set the order of the questions in the section and the sections in the questionnaire. You can manage the order by dragging sections and questions. You can drag questions from one section to another. </div>
</li><li>
<div>If you delete a section, questions of this section are also deleted.</div></li></ul><h3>View questionnaire</h3>
<ul><li>
<div>When you select a table question in questionnaire template sections, you can see its appearance at the bottom of the template. To get a picture of how the respondent will see the whole questionnaire while responding, click <strong>Filling form</strong>.</div></li></ul><h3>Save questionnaire template</h3>
<ul><li>If you plan to continue working on the template, click <strong>Write and close</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Template edit prohibition</h3>
<ul><li>Once the list of questions in the questionnaire template is generated, you can prohibit its further editing. To do so, click <strong>End editing</strong>. 
</li><li>If at least one questionnaire is generated from a template, the questionnaire template automatically becomes read-only. For proper analysis of responses to questionnaires in reports, a template must remain unchanged because data is analyzed for all questionnaires populated from this template.</li></ul><h3><a name="#1">Simple question</a></h3>
<ul><li>Click <strong>Add - Simple question</strong> to pick a question from the <strong>Questions for questionnaire</strong> list for the template. You can also press <strong>Shift+F6</strong>. 
</li><li>Fill in the following fields to create <strong>Questionnaire template question</strong>: 
<ul><li>In the <strong>Elementary question</strong> field, select a question from the previously prepared list of questionnaire questions. The <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.QuestionsForSurvey.Form.ItemForm/Help">question</a> description is shown in this field. You can create a question in the <a href="ChartOfCharacteristicTypes.QuestionsForSurvey.Form.ChoiceForm/Help">selection list</a> if there is no question you need. 
</li><li>The <strong>Wording</strong> field is populated automatically with a question wording text once a questionnaire question is selected. Here you can change the question wording to be shown to respondents in questionnaires of this template. 
</li><li>If the <strong>Required</strong> check box is selected, the respondent will be unable to complete the questionnaire and answer this question. 
</li><li>In the <strong>Notes</strong> field, write clarifying information about the question to be displayed at the bottom of the questionnaire.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><a name="#2">Table question</a></h3>
<ul><li>It is easy to enter similar structured data in tables. For example, it is better to place information on family members in a table. The columns will include questions about family members, family members will be listed in the rows in order, and their characteristics will be placed in the table question order. 
</li><li>Click <strong>Add - Table question</strong> to open <a href="Catalog.QuestionnaireTemplates.Form.TableQuestionsWizardForm/Help">Table question wizard</a>. Follow the wizard instructions to enter a table question.</li></ul><h3><a name="#3">Question</a> with condition</h3>
<ul><li>There are cases where there is no point in asking the respondent a question if no condition is fulfilled. For example, there is no point in asking the respondent how ofter they use a car service or a car wash if the respondent does not have a car. 
</li><li>In this case, on creating a questionnaire template, you can create a question with condition, for example, about whether the respondent has a car and add subordinate questions, for example, about a car service and a car wash. 
</li><li>If the answer to the question with condition is positive, the respondent will be asked to answer subordinate questions as well. Otherwise, subordinate questions will be unavailable. 
</li><li>To create questions with condition, click <strong>Add - Question with condition</strong> or press <strong>Shift+F8</strong>. Only questions of the <strong>Boolean</strong> type (<strong>Yes/No</strong>) can be questions with condition. 
</li><li>You need to add one or several subordinate questions to each question with condition by clicking <strong>Add - Simple question</strong> or <strong>Add - Table question</strong>. Subordinate questions are displayed under their parent conditional question.</li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
