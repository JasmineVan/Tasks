<p>This list is used to store additional reports and data processors in an application.</p>
<p>You can connect and utilize a variety of additional (external) reports and data processors in 1C:Enterprise mode. This extends the application's functionality without making any changes to the application, which can be useful when you need to custom-fit the application to specific purposes without losing the technical support rights.</p>
<p>The additional reports and data processors are created in Designer mode. If you want an additional report or data processor created, you need to contact the developers with this request. Alternately, you can download pre-made reports from the Internet.</p>
<p>To enable additional reports and data processors, use the <strong>Print forms, reports and data processors</strong> command in the <strong>Administration</strong> section and select the corresponding check box. This will enable the <strong>Additional reports and data processors</strong> command. By default, the check box is selected. </p>
<p>The list includes the following columns:</p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Name</strong> - full name of a report or data processor.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Type</strong> - there is several <a href="#1">types of additional report or data processors</a>, to be specified by developer. Available fucntionality is governed by the report type.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Publication</strong> - visibility of additional reports and data processors, color-marked. Additional reports and data processors in debug mode are marked in red and accessible by administrator only. Disabled additional reports and data processors are marked in grey. Additional reports and data processors marked for deletion are disabled and marked both in grey and with a special icon.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Version</strong> - data processor version number specified by developer.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Person responsible</strong> - application user assigned a person responsible for this report or data processor. This user (by default, Administrator) is responsible for monitoring the additional report/data processor version changes, updating to latest versions, and more.</div></li></ul><p>Using <strong>More - Change form</strong>, you can add the following fields:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Object name</strong> - includes kind and other information. This field is filled in by developer and displayed in the appliction by default. 
</li><li><strong>Permission compatibility mode</strong> - application version used with the report or data processor. 
</li><li><strong>Comment</strong> - detailed information on the additional report or data processor. 
</li><li><strong>Use option storage</strong> - property for additional reports. Takes on the Yes value if the additional repost stores data in the application option storage; 
</li><li><strong>Use for list form</strong> - takes on Yes if the command calling the additional report or data processor is located in list windows. 
</li><li><strong>Use for object form</strong> - takes on Yes if the command calling the additional report or data processor is located in list item windows. 
</li><li><strong>Information</strong> - description of the additional report or data processor provided by developer. 
</li><li><strong>File name</strong> - name and extension of the additional report or data processor file. 
</li><li><strong>Safe mode</strong> - takes on Yes if the additional report or data processor is executed in safe mode. As a rule, data processors are to be executed in safe mode. This ensures that they do not contain unsafe program code executed on the server. However, certain data processors may require execution in unsafe mode. In this case, a warning will be displayed. These data processors should only be obtained from trusted sources (vendors) or manually audited before execution. For more information on safe mode, refer to the 1C:Enterprise platform documentation.</li></ul><h3>Registering additional reports or data processors</h3>
<ul><li>Click <strong>Add from file</strong>, select <a href="v8help://1cv8/ExtRepotrs">an external report or data processor</a> file on your computer (specify full path to it), and <a href="Catalog.AdditionalReportsAndDataProcessors.Form.ItemForm/Help">configure its parameters</a>. The data list may vary depending on the purpose of the selected report or data processor. If an invalid file was specified, an error message will be displayed (example: the selected additional data processor cannot be used with the current application version). </li></ul><h3>Filters</h3>
<p>The following filters can be enabled to facilitate your navigation of extensive lists of additional reports and data processors:</p>
<ul><li>
<div>By the <strong>Kind</strong> field - select an additional report or data processor kind from the filter list (for example, Report).</div>
</li><li>
<div>By the <strong>Publication</strong> field - select a state to be used in filter (for example, Used).</div>
</li><li>
<div>By both <strong>Kind</strong> and <strong>Publication</strong> fields - in extensive lists, both filters can be combined.</div></li></ul><h3>Loading from file</h3>
<ul><li>Use the <strong>Load from file</strong> command to update a data processor in the internal application storage. Specify the file path and click <strong>Open</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Saving to file</h3>
<ul><li>Use the <strong>Save to file</strong> command to export a data processor or report from storage to a file. Specify the folder and click <strong>Save</strong>. File name will be generated automatically but can be changed if necessary.</li></ul><h3><a name="1">Additional report and data processor kinds</a></h3>
<p>Additional reports and data processors are categorized into the following types:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Global (common) reports and data processors</strong> - these are used independently from the application data. Commands for working with global reports and data processors are located in the application sections. Global reports and data processors can be used to import data into the application, update or clear the full-text search index, etc. They contain commands that can only be called from command interface sections. The commands are independent of any applied objects. The list of sections where commands can be placed is predefined by the developer, included in additional report or data processor file, and cannot be modified. 
</li><li><strong>Assignable additional reports and data processors</strong> - these are used with specific application lists or documents, single or multiple. The list of objects to which such a report or data processor can be assigned is predefined by developeraк and embedded into text of the report or data processor. When assigning a report, you can only select targets from this list. This type is further broken down into subtypes: 
<ul><li><strong>Report</strong> - assignable additional report. It can be used to create a report on a specific applied object. 
</li><li><strong>Object filling</strong> - assignable additional data processor that can be used to automatically fill in or clear single or multiple list items. 
</li><li><strong>Print form</strong> - assignable additional data processor that can be used to create new print forms for a document. 
</li><li><strong>Related object creation</strong> - assignable additional data processor that can be used to fill in lists quickly by copying list items.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Creating additional data processor or report</h3>
<ul><li>
<div>Create an additional data processor or report.</div>
</li><li>
<div>The additional data processor or report is registered in the infobase using the data it provides. These data is to be returned as structure in function <strong>ExternalDataProcessorInfo</strong>.</div></li></ul><h3>Example of how to implement the ExternalDataProcessorInfo function using the application interface </h3>
