<p>Registering <a href="Catalog.AdditionalReportsAndDataProcessors/Help">additional reports and data processors</a> in the application.</p>
<p>Some of the data in additional report or data processor cards is filled in automatically. This data was specified by developers in external data processor or report files and cannot be modified (command list, additional information). Any additional data processor can support one or several commands available in applied object windows or in application sections.</p>
<p>Two types of additional reports and data processors are available: </p>
<ul><li><a href="#A">Assignable</a> - intended for use with one or more specific application lists or documents. The list of objects to which an additional report or data processor can be assigned is predefined by the developer and specified in the text of the additional report or data processor. When registering an additional report or data processor, you can only select them from the list. 
</li><li><a href="#B">Global or common</a> - contain commands that can only be called from command interface sections. The commands are independent of any applied objects. The list of sections where commands can be placed is predefined by the developer, included in additional report or data processor file, and cannot be modified.</li></ul><p>Depending on their purpose and settings, additional reports and data processors can contain multiple tabs. In this case, mandatory commands are located on a separate tab. The <strong>Additional information</strong> tab which is also mandatory contains information on the additional data processor or report. Names and content of other tabs may vary. Special commands can also be located on additional tabs.</p>
<p>When registering an additional report or data processor, you need to specify its primary parameters:</p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Description</strong> - provided by developer and filled in automatically. Can be modified if necessary.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Operation mode</strong> - <a href="#1">attachment mode</a> of additional reports and data processors. Possible values: <strong>Safe</strong> and <strong>Unsafe</strong>.</div>
</li><li>
<div>
<p><strong>Publication</strong> radio button - controls report or data processor availability. Can be used to limit access to reports or data processors. You can make a report or data processor available for anyone, available for administrator only, or unavailable. This parameter can take on the following values:</p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Used</strong> - data processor or report is available for use. Data processor commands are available for all application users with the Use additional reports and data processors role assigned.</div>
</li><li>
<div>
<div><strong>Debug mode</strong> - data processor or report is only available to users with role Add and edit additional data processors or Full access (displayed in red in the list.) For all other users, these commands are hidden. We recommend selecting this mode when an additional report or data processor requires validations.</div></div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Disabled</strong> - data processor or report is unavailable and cannot be selected from the list. We recommend selecting this mode when you need to make a data processor or report temporarily unavailable while keeping all its settings intact. To make a data processor or report available again, select any other mode.</div></li></ul></div>
</li><li><strong>Comment</strong> - enter detailed description here. 
</li><li>
<div><strong>Person responsible</strong> - assign a user responsible for monitoring additional report or data processor state, updates, and so on. Default assignee is Administrator.</div></li></ul><h3>Additional information</h3>
<ul><li>Additional information provided by developer is shown: 
<ul><li><strong>Kind</strong> - there are the following kinds of additional reports and data processors: 
<ul><li><strong>Additional report</strong> 
</li><li><strong>Report</strong> 
</li><li><strong>Object filling</strong> 
</li><li><strong>Print form</strong> 
</li><li><strong>Creating related objects</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>File name</strong> 
</li><li><strong>Version</strong> 
</li><li><strong>Object name</strong> 
</li><li><strong>Comment</strong> - detailed information on the additional report or data processor.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Group</strong> - add an additional data processor or report to a group. Select a group from the list. Using groups makes it easier to work with additional reports and data processors.</li></ul><h3>Loading from file</h3>
<ul><li>Use the <strong>Load from file</strong> command to update a data processor in the internal application storage. Kind of the data processor being imported must match the current data processor kind. Specify the file path and click <strong>Open</strong>.</li></ul><h3>Saving to file</h3>
<ul><li>Use the <strong>Save to file</strong> command to export a data processor or report from storage to a file. Specify the folder and click <strong>Save</strong>. File name will be generated automatically but can be changed if necessary.</li></ul><h3><a name="1">Run mode</a></h3>
<ul><li>As a rule, data processors are to be executed in safe mode. This ensures that they do not contain unsafe program code executed on the server. 
</li><li>However, certain data processors may require execution in unsafe mode. These data processors should only be obtained from trusted sources (vendors) or manually audited before execution. 
</li><li>For more information on safe mode, refer to the 1C:Enterprise platform documentation.</li></ul><h3>Notes on registering <a name="A">assignable</a> additional reports and data processors</h3>
<ul><li>For additional reports and data processors intended for work with application lists or documents, you can select objects, for which data processor or report commands will be available. 
<ul><li><strong>Placement</strong>. To select application objects, click the hyperlink that lists the selected objects or displays <strong>Undefined</strong> if no object is selected. Select objects using check boxes. 
</li><li><strong>Show</strong> - commands for data processors or reports can be available in: 
<ul><li>The list of selected objects if the <strong>In lists</strong> check box is selected. 
</li><li>The applied object window if the <strong>In catalog and document item forms</strong> check box is selected. The check boxes are not mutually exclusive and can be both selected.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>
<div>on the <strong>Commands</strong> tab, the list of commands is filled by default from the list provided by developer. These commands are added to the specified list or document when the additional report or data processor is attached.</div></li></ul><h3>Notes on registering <a name="B">global</a> (common) additional reports and data processors</h3>
<ul><li>For each report and data processor called from command interface (not attached to a configuration object), you need to specify the interface sections where you can access the data processor commands using the <strong>Additional reports</strong> and <strong>Additional data processors</strong> commands. 
<ul><li><strong>Placement</strong> - to select interface sections, click the hyperlink that lists the selected sections or displays <strong>Undefined</strong> when no section is selected. Select the required sections using check boxes and click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm.</li></ul></li><li>List of commands and their settings can be located on a separate <strong>Commands</strong> tab. The tab shows: 
<ul><li><strong>Name</strong> - full name of the command. 
</li><li>In the <strong>Quick access</strong> column, click <img src="StdPicture.InputFieldSelect"></img> (or press <strong>F4</strong>) and select the users who can access this command by default. The default value is None. Add users to the list. Click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm selection and return to the setup procedure. 
</li><li>In the <strong>Schedule column</strong>, for each global report or data processor command executed on server side, click <img src="StdPicture.InputFieldSelect"></img> and set a <a href="DataProcessor.ScheduledAndBackgroundJobs.Form.ScheduledJob/Help">scheduled job</a> for running the command. Commands with the <strong>Open form</strong> launch option enabled cannot be scheduled.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Creating additional data processor or report</h3>
<ul><li>
<div>Create an additional data processor or report.</div>
</li><li>
<div>The additional data processor or report is registered in the infobase using the data it provides. These data is to be returned as structure in function ExternalDataProcessorInfo.</div></li></ul><h3>Example of how to implement the ExternalDataProcessorInfo function using the application interface </h3>
