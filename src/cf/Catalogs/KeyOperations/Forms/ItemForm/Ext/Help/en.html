<p>Description of key operation parameters. </p>
<p>A number of predefined <a href="Catalog.KeyOperations/Help">key operations</a> are available in the application. More can be added if necessary. Key operations may include any common operations supported by the application, such as document posting, report generation, and more. To evaluate application performance, you need to manually fill in parameters for each key operation in the <a href="Catalog.KeyOperationProfiles/Help">key operation profile</a> (as these parameters are not filled in automatically after installation). </p>
<h3>Key operation parameters</h3>
<ul><li><strong>Name</strong> - this field is filled in for predefined key operations; for each user-created key operation, you need to enter its name manually. This field is mandatory; 
</li><li><strong>Priority</strong> - specify priority (an integer) for each key operation. No key operations can share the same priority. This field is mandatory; 
</li><li><strong>Target time</strong> - specify time (in seconds). This field is mandatory; 
</li><li><strong>Minimum level</strong> - select a value from list (for example, <strong>Fair</strong>).</li></ul><p>Application performance tests are based on these key operation parameters.</p>
<h3>Viewing time measurements</h3>
<ul><li>Application <a href="DataProcessor.PerformanceMonitor/Help">performance tests</a> include <a href="InformationRegister.TimeMeasurements/Help">time measurements</a> performed for each key operation. To view the history of time measurements for each key operation, click <strong>Time measurements</strong> on the navigation panel.</li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
