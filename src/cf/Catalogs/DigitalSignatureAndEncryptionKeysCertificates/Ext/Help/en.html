<p>Digital signature verifies that an electronic document was not altered in any way since the moment it was signed. To sign a document, you need a digital signature key <a href="Catalog.DigitalSignatureAndEncryptionKeysCertificates.Form.ItemForm/Help">certificate</a>. Digital signature key certificates are available from cryptography services (providers) or can be generated by your operating system.</p>
<p>Electronic document integrity is verified by matching the digital signature with the digital signature key certificate. If the digital signature matches the certificate, this guarantees that the document was not altered in any way since the moment it was signed. Integrity control of an electronic document can be performed at any moment of time.</p>
<p>The digital signature allows you to:</p>
<ul><li>Sign the application objects (for example, the <strong>Description</strong> and <strong>Summary</strong> fields) 
</li><li><a href="Catalog.DigitalSignatureAndEncryptionKeysCertificates.Form.DataSigning/Help">Sign</a> the content of the stored files 
</li><li><a href="Catalog.DigitalSignatureAndEncryptionKeysCertificates.Form.DataEncryption/Help">Encrypt</a> the content of the stored files 
</li><li><a href="Catalog.DigitalSignatureAndEncryptionKeysCertificates.Form.DataDecryption/Help">Decrypt</a> the encrypted files</li></ul></body></html>
