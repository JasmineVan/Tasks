<p>Use this window to set up contact information kinds in application documents and lists. </p>
<p>The application allows you to store and process contact information used in your organization.</p>
<p>You can work with contact information in all application lists in the same manner. All lists provide the same functionality for working with addresses or phone numbers. In the application, you can store contact information in tabular sections of documents and load it. You can edit contact information in tabular sections of documents. You might need it when working with accounting reports in digital format. This is because you will likely need to save an exact copy of data submitted to tax authorities (including addresses and phone numbers of individuals).</p>
<p>The application is distributed with predefined groups and list items. Predefined list groups correspond to specific application lists or documents containing contact information. New groups cannot be added to the list. Items contained in these groups define content of contact information of the related application objects.</p>
<p>In lists and tabular sections of application documents, a variety of predefined contact information kinds is available. Besides, new contact information kinds can be added, if necessary. </p>
<p>We recommend that you set up contact information kinds during the initial infobase population stage. However, you can perform the setup later. Usually, the application administrator performs the setup.</p>
<p>You can open the list by clicking the matching command on the navigation panel in <strong>Administration - Common settings - Contact information</strong>.</p>
