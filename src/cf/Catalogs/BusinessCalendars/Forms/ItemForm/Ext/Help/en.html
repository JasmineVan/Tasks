<p>View or generate a business calendar.</p>
<p>Business calendar is a kind of classifier, permanent information that does not change during the year.</p>
<p>The Business calendar of the Russian Federation (which is nationwide) is included in the delivered application data and updated as the calendar is approved and holidays are substituted in the Russian Federation. </p>
<p>You can enter more than one <a href="Catalog.BusinessCalendars/Help">business calendar</a>, if you need to. There can be several business calendars as holidays and preholiday days vary in different regions.</p>
<p>It is recommended to enter the business calendar at the beginning of the year on the basis of the national calendar for the whole year at once. By doing this you will avoid errors in calculations throughout the year.</p>
<p>Business calendar itself is not used in accounting. <a href="Catalog.Calendars/Help">Work schedules</a> of departments, as well as work schedules of employees are generated on the basis of the business calendar.</p>

<p>This feature makes sense if you need the calendar data, but officially it has not yet been approved and the application does not have it, because the government has not approved all substitute holidays.
