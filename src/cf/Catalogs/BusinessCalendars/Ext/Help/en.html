<p>Business calendar is a kind of classifier, permanent information that does not change during the year. There can be several business calendars as holidays and preholiday days vary in different regions. </p>
<p>The <strong>Business calendar of the Russian Federation</strong> (which is nationwide) is included in the delivered application data and updated as the calendar is approved and holidays are substituted in the Russian Federation. You can enter more than one business calendar, if you need to. It is recommended to enter the business calendar at the beginning of the year on the basis of the national calendar for the whole year at once. By doing this you will avoid errors in calculations throughout the year.</p><a name="СтандартныеПодсистемы.ГрафикиРаботы">
