<p>Use the list to keep work schedules.</p>
<p>The application allows you to generate and store work schedules used in the enterprise. Work schedules are generated based on <a href="Catalog.BusinessCalendars/Help">business calendars</a>. Work schedules can be applied to the whole enterprise or to a specific department (for example, warehouse work schedule). A department work schedule contains information on workdays in this department. For example, if goods are received from customers in an enterprise warehouse on Tuesdays and Thursdays, then Tuesdays and Thursdays are workdays for work schedule "Goods receiving in warehouse".</p>
<p>Depending on production need or demands of departments, for which a work schedule is intended, you can configure work schedules for a whole year or for a particular period. You can also configure a work schedule on a regular basis during the year for several days in advance.</p>
<p>The list includes the following columns:</p>
<ul><li>
<div><strong>Name</strong>. This field is filled in upon creating a schedule.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Business calendar</strong>. A business calendar based on which the work schedule is created.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Filling method</strong>. Schedule kind. Depending on filling method, there are two kinds of schedules:</div>
<ul><li>
<div>By weeks (hourly). Such schedule is strictly linked to days of the week. This is the most basic and common kind of work schedule. 40-hour workweek is an example of this schedule kind. Such schedules differ only by the number of worked time and days. Five-day working week, six-day working week, and two working days during the week are examples of this work schedule.</div>
</li><li>
<div>By cycles of arbitrary length. Such schedule is strictly linked to days of the month, as a particular date is specified as a cycle start, from which cycle days are calculated. Such work schedules are not affected by days of the week and rarely affected by holidays. Cyclical work schedule examples are shift-based schedules and schedules with sliding weekend: one workday with three days off, two workdays with two days off, etc.</div></li></ul></li><li>
<div><strong>Possible reason</strong>. A result of checking if the schedule is filled in correctly. If some errors in schedule filling are detected, a warning message appears.</div>
</li><li>
<div><strong>Description</strong>. Detailed description filled in upon creating a schedule.</div></li></ul><p>Work schedules filled in incorrectly are marked in red.</p>
<h3>Setting work schedules</h3>
<ul><li>Create as many work schedules as necessary based on the business calendar. 
</li><li>Specify workdays for each work schedule. Fill in each work schedule for as many days ahead as best for the schedule users' convenience. 
</li><li>At the end of year, fill in the work schedule ahead for several days of the next year (until the date of release of the official calendar for the next year), based on the last year data; this helps to avoid potential issues when preparing documents.</li></ul><h3>Creating new work schedule</h3>
<p>Click <strong>Create</strong> and fill in the <a href="Catalog.Calendars.Form.ItemForm/Help">fields</a>.</p>
<h3>Grouping work schedules</h3>
<p>Long lists of work schedules can be grouped for convenience. You can group work schedules by various criteria, for example, by filling method.</p>
<ul><li>
<div>To create a group, click <img src="StdPicture.CreateFolder"></img>, and specify the group name. You can subordinate a group to another one if required. To create a subordinate group, select a parent group during the creation procedure.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Create as many groups as you need, and then drag one or more work schedules into each group.</div></li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
