<p>Information on work schedules.</p>
<p>A work schedule is created based on <a href="Catalog.BusinessCalendars.Form.ItemForm/Help">business calendar</a>. You can create <a href="Catalog.Calendars/Help">work schedules</a> for the whole enterprise and for departments (for example, warehouse work schedule).</p>
<p>Depending on production need or demands of departments, for which a work schedule is intended, you can configure work schedules for a whole year or for a particular period. You can also configure a work schedule on a regular basis during the year for several days in advance.</p>
<h3>Creating new work schedule</h3>
<ul><li>Enter the <strong>Name</strong>, for example, IT department work schedule. 
</li><li>Specify <strong>Schedule filling period</strong>, for example, <strong>from</strong> 01/01/2014 <strong>to</strong> 07/31/2014. 
<ul><li>Do one of the following: 
<ul><li>Type dates manually. 
</li><li>Select dates from the calendar by clicking <img src="StdPicture.InputFieldCalendar"></img>. </li></ul></li><li>By default, the period starts on January 1 of the current year. 
</li><li>If the period ends on December 31, you can leave this field blank. By default, the application fills in the schedule until the end of the year.</li></ul></li><li>From the <a href="Catalog.BusinessCalendars/Help">list</a>, select a <strong>Business calendar</strong> based on which the schedule is created. There can be several business calendars as holidays and preholiday days vary in different regions. If only a single business calendar is available in the enterprise, it is filled in automatically by default. 
</li><li>Select <strong>Filling method</strong>: 
<ul><li><strong>By weeks</strong>. A weekly or hourly work schedule is linked to days of the week. This is the most basic and common kind of work schedule. 40-hour workweek is an example of this schedule kind. As well as five-day workweek, six-day workweek, two-day workweek, etc. Such schedules differ only by the number of worked time and days. <strong></strong>
</li><li><strong>By cycles</strong>. Such schedule is linked to days of the month, as a particular date is specified as a cycle start date, from which cycle days are calculated. Such work schedules are not affected by days of the week and rarely affected by holidays. Cyclical work schedule examples are shift-based schedules and schedules with sliding weekend: one workday with three days off, two workdays with two days off, etc. 
<ul><li>Let us review an example work schedule for a warehouse that works around the clock for 4 days. The warehouse closes for one day for equipment maintenance and sanitation. In this case, the cycle length is 5 days. 
<ul><li>Enter the cycle length, for example, <strong>By cycle with length</strong> 5 <strong>days</strong>. The field is required. 
</li><li>Specify the cycle start, for example, <strong>starting from</strong> 01/03/2014. The field is required. It is filled in by the application automatically. By default, the cycle starts from the beginning of <strong>Schedule filling period</strong> (for example, from 01/01/2014), if required, you can specify another date.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Create <strong>Filling template</strong>. Do one of the following: 
<ul><li>Select check boxes for workdays. This is enough to display both workdays and days off in the work schedule. After that, you can go to next steps of work schedule filling, view the filling result, and save the work schedule. 
</li><li>Enter work schedule for each workday by clicking <strong>Fill in schedule</strong>. Usually, the enterprise and its departments work on a particular schedule. 
<ul><li>Specify <strong>Work schedule</strong> for each workday of a week or cycle by clicking <strong>Add</strong>. Enter <strong>Start time</strong> and <strong>End time</strong> of the workday. 
<ul><li>Only work hours are included in the schedule. If there are some breaks, fill in the work schedule in several rows as breaks are not included in work hours. Days off are not filled in. 
</li><li>After you fill in the schedule, click <strong>OK</strong>. In the link, you will see the total number of work hours and work mode. Check boxes for workdays are selected automatically. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Select the <strong>Consider holidays</strong> check box if required. This will automatically exclude any dates specified as holidays in the selected business calendar from the work schedule. 
<ul><li>If holidays are considered in the work schedule and a different work schedule is assigned to preholiday days, click <strong>Fill in schedule</strong> to fill in <strong>Preholiday schedule</strong> similarly to the work schedule. </li></ul></li><li>Specify <strong>Planning horizon</strong>. Enter a number of months for which the schedule is to be filled in advance. If the planning horizon is filled in, the application compares the schedule filling period with the number of months specified in the planning horizon. If the schedule is not filled in until the required date, a warning message appears. 
</li><li>In the information field under the <strong>Planning horizon</strong> field, the application specifies the date until which the work schedule is filled in. 
</li><li>Fill in <strong>Description</strong>. Enter detailed information on the created schedule. This helps to find a work schedule among many work schedules in the list.</li></ul><h3>Viewing work schedules</h3>
<ul><li>Click <strong>Filling result</strong>. All workdays and days off will be displayed by months. 
</li><li>Click <strong>Fill settings</strong> to finish viewing and continue work with the work schedule.</li></ul><h3>See also:</h3>
