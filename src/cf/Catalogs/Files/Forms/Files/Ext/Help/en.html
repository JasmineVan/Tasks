<p>The application allows you to store files in the infobase without linking them to certain objects. The list is designed to manage such files.</p>
<p>Working with the list is similar to those in the <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>. </p>
<p>On the left side of the list, there is a hierarchical <a href="Catalog.FilesFolders/Help">folder </a>structure. The list contains predefined folders that cannot be deleted, for example, <strong>File templates</strong> folder. </p>
<p>On the right side of the list, you can see a list of files stored in the selected folder. You can <strong>Add</strong> new files and folders to the list, <strong>Copy</strong>, <strong>Edit</strong> or <strong>Mark them for deletion</strong> using <a href="Catalog.Files/Help">commands</a> of the context menu or <strong>More actions</strong> menu.</p>
<p>To work with file attributes (author, name, description, etc.), use the <a href="Catalog.Files.Form.ItemForm/Help">file profile</a> (<strong>More </strong>menu - <strong>Open card</strong>). Working with the file itself (<strong>View </strong>or <strong>Edit </strong>file) is performed in the application installed on your computer. </p>
<p>When editing a file, its previous <a href="DataProcessor.FilesOperations.Form.AttachedFileVersion/Help">version </a>is automatically saved in the infobase. This setting is set as default. We do not recommend that you change this setting because if a file was damaged during editing, you can go back to one of its previous <a href="Catalog.FilesVersions/Help">versions</a>. </p>
<p>Files that you lock for editing are highlighted in green. Gray color is used for files locked for editing by other application users.</p>
<p>The list includes the following columns:</p>
<ul><li><img src="CommonPicture.SignedEncryptedTitle"></img> . Shows whether the file has a digital signature, or it is encrypted. 
</li><li><strong>Name</strong>. Full name of a file. An icon next to the name specifies file type. In the same column, you can see a full file description. 
</li><li><strong>Author</strong>. Name of the user who added the file. 
</li><li><strong>Date changed</strong>. Date and time a file version is added to the infobase. </li></ul><p>By clicking <strong>More - Change form</strong>, you can add some fields, for example:</p>
<ul><div>
<li><strong>Edited</strong>. User who added a file version. 
</li><li><strong>Current version</strong>. Code of the current version, etc.</li></div></ul><h3>Adding files</h3>
