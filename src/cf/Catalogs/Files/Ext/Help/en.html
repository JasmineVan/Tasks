<p>In the application, you can store files of custom format. Unlike storing files on disks or in the corporate document management systems, files are linked with application data. This makes it more convenient to store files. Different lists, documents, business processes, and other application objects can act as a custodian for files. Operations with files attached to the object are performed in the <a href="DataProcessor.FilesOperations.Form.AttachedFiles/Help">Attached files</a> list. You can open the list by choosing a necessary command on the navigation panel of the document or other application object. You can also store files without linking them to a particular object in the <a href="Catalog.Files.Form.Files/Help">file list</a>.</p>
<p>To work with file attributes (author, name, description, etc.), use the <a href="Catalog.Files.Form.ItemForm/Help">file profile</a>. Working with the file itself is performed in the application installed on your computer. When editing a file, its previous <a href="Catalog.FilesVersions/Help">version </a>is automatically saved in the infobase.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>File operations</h3>
<p></p>
<p>To perform file operations, use commands on the command bar, or in the <strong>More </strong>menu in the file list, in the context menu, or in the file profile: </p>
