<p>The object is aimed at managing report options and configuring placement in report panels of the application sections.</p>
<p>You can save and use multiple options of the same report in the application. There are predefined report options. You can also generate custom report options by changing settings of the existing ones: generation and appearance (fields content, sorting, groupings, conditional formatting) <a href="v8help://mngui/reportFormMain">settings</a>.</p>
<p>You can generate common report options. Common report options are available to all users of the report.</p>
<p>The application sections contain commands for going to <a href="CommonForm.ReportPanel/Help">report panels</a> defined in these sections. If there are many reports, they are combined according to the section groups. For your convenience, you can configure report panels, for example: hide rarely used report options, add frequently used report options to quick access. </p>
<p>Report options administrators can also configure report panel appearance in the application: a report option can be marked as important or placed to the <strong>See also</strong> group.</p>
<p>To open the list, in the report panel of the application section, execute the <strong>All reports</strong> command. Sections and groups structure in this list depends on granted rights and roles. All report options without exceptions are available only to an application administrator.</p>
<p>The application administrator can open the list by executing the <strong>Report options</strong> command in the <strong>Administration - Print forms, reports, and data processors</strong> section. Some commands or actions available for administrators may be unavailable in the <strong>All reports</strong> list. This feature is mentioned in the description of list features.</p>
<p>The list consists of two sections: </p>
<ul><li>the left section contains a tree of sections and command interface groups that have report panels. 
<ul><li>When moving from one tree node to another, the list is automatically filtered by the selected section or group. 
</li><li>Use the <strong>Including subordinate ones</strong> check box to display all reports of a section or a group including report options of subordinate groups. </li></ul></li><li>The right section contains a report list. </li></ul><p>The list includes the following columns: </p>
