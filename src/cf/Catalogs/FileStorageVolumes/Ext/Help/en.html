<p>This list is used for file storage volume management.</p>
<p>It is only utilized when the <strong>In volumes on hard disk</strong> file storage mode is active. To access this list, select the <strong>Store files in volumes on hard disk </strong>check box located in the <strong>Administration - File operation settings</strong> section. This will enable the <strong>File storage volumes</strong> command located in the <strong>Administration - File operation settings</strong> section. Execute this command to open the list. If you change the file storage mode, the files will not be moved from the application to the volumes or vice versa.</p>
<p>The list includes the following columns:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Name</strong>. Name of the file storage volume. 
</li><li><strong>Order</strong>. An integer. Storage volumes are filled in order (ascending) until each volume is full. 
</li><li><strong>Full path for Microsoft Windows</strong>. Path to the volume folder on a Microsoft Windows server in the <strong>UNC</strong> format: \\Computer name\Folder name\File name 
</li><li><strong>Comment</strong>. Detailed information on the volume. 
</li><li><strong>Limit, MB</strong>. You can specify the maximum size of all the files in the volume (volume quota). If the quota equals zero, it will not be checked upon placing files in the volume. If the <strong>Max size</strong> does not equal zero, when total size of all files stored in a volume exceeds the quota set for this volume, the next volume in fill order will be used for file storage. If none of the available volumes have sufficient free capacity for file storage, this event will be added to the <a href="DataProcessor.EventLog/Help">event log</a> and an error message will be displayed. 
</li><li><strong>Full path for Linux</strong>. Path to the volume on Linux server.</li></ul><h3>Creating file storage volumes</h3>
<ul><li>Select <strong>Create</strong> and fill in the required <a href="Catalog.FileStorageVolumes.Form.ItemForm/Help">fields</a>. 
</li><li>You must specify one or several folders located on hard disks of server running the application or other servers in the network, to be used for file storage.</li></ul><h3>Rules for storing files in volumes</h3>
<ul><li>
<div>If you select or clear the <strong>Store files in volumes on the hard disk</strong> check box, you will no be able to cancel your changes. If you disable volume file storage, new files will be added to the infobase while the old ones will remain in volumes. A volume folder will be used until the infobase stores at least one file. Files that were previously saved to volumes open from these volumes.</div>
</li><li>
<div>If you save a file in a volume, and then delete the volume by external means, the file will not be found even if the <strong>Store files in volumes on the hard disk</strong> check box is already disabled. Selecting or clearing the check box will not bring the missing files back.</div>
</li><li>
<div>If the application cannot find the files stored in volumes, you should look for error messages in the event log, see the path to the volume folder, check the location of this folder, make sure it contains the file you need, and restore the folder if necessary. To be able to restore folders, make sure you perform regular back-ups of volume folders by external means, for example, by operating system means.</div></li></ul><h3>Managing file storage volumes</h3>
<ul><li>When creating a new storage volume, access to folder specified in the <strong>Full path</strong> field is validated automatically. If the path is invalid, a warning message will be displayed. 
</li><li>Storage volumes are filled in order (ascending) until each volume is full. You can use this to temporarily disable a volume by increasing its filling order. 
</li><li>Path to an existing volume cannot be modified. 
</li><li>A volume cannot be deleted while it is being referenced by any file versions. 
</li><li>Volume access errors are recorded to the <a href="DataProcessor.EventLog/Help">event log</a> and can be viewed by the application administrator. 
</li><li>Files in each volume are stored in subfolders organized by date. A new subfolder is created for every day. All stored files retain their original names and extensions, with version number added in the middle. Example: original file name Orders.txt, version number 1, resulting file name Orders.1.txt. 
</li><li>Toggling file storage mode does not affect the currently stored files; it only defines how the new files will be stored. For example, if you enable the <strong>In volumes on hard disk</strong> file storage mode, this does not move the currently stored files to volumes; only new files will be stored in volumes. To <a href="DataProcessor.MoveFilesToVolumes/Help">move the currently stored files</a> from the infobase to volumes, use the <strong>Transfer files to volumes</strong>. 
</li><li>If data synchronization is enabled between two applications and the source application stores files in volumes on hard disk, the <a href="CommonForm.CreateInitialImageWithFiles/Help">initial image creation</a> procedure must include creation of a compressed file containing the file storage volumes. 
</li><li>Accordingly, the procedure of initial image import to the target application must include specifying location of the compressed file with the file storage volumes. To <a href="CommonForm.SelectPathToVolumeFilesArchive/Help">extract the volume-based files from the compressed file</a>, use the <strong>Store initial image files</strong> command.</li></ul><table width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="36"><img src="CommonPicture.Warning32" width="32" height="32"></img></td>
<td>Note<br>To start using volumes located on network disks, you need to run the 1C:Enterprise 8 server on behalf of a domain user (such as <strong>domain1\user1</strong>) with access rights to volume location specified as UNC path. This user must be a member of the <strong>Users</strong> group on the local computer, have Run as service and Run as batch job rights, and have access rights to folders where system files of 1C:Enterprise 8 server (event log, temporary files, etc) are stored.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>See also:</h3>
