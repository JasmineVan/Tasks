<p>Use this list to store users working with the application. </p>
<p>You can open the list of users from <strong>Administration—Users and rights settings</strong> section or from <strong>Access management—</strong><strong>Users</strong> section.</p>
<p>Only administrators and external user list managers can edit the user list. </p>
<p>Authorization of an external user requires administrator's approval.</p>
<p>User list managers have the right to add external users and edit them (to a limited degree). They configure users prior to their authorization approval by administrator. User list managers can edit the <strong>Users</strong> and <strong>User groups</strong> lists.</p>
<p>Users can view their personal data and edit personal parameters, such as password, application interface language, and contact information. </p>
<p>Users created by list managers are assigned the <strong>Requires approval</strong> status. Application administrators can filter users by this parameter, verify accuracy of the entered data, and allow authorization.</p>
<p>Once an administrator approves authorization for a user, list managers will be unable to change their authorization settings in any way, with the exception of revoking the authorization approval.</p>
<p>In a distributed infobase, authorization is configured for each infobase separately.</p>
<p>Long lists of users can be grouped for convenience. For instance, companies can use <a href="Catalog.UserGroups/Help">user groups</a> that copy their organizational structure.</p>
<p>You can also right-click anywhere in the list to open a menu with user list management commands. </p>
