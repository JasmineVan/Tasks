<p>Use this form to describe user properties.</p>
<p>To <a href="#1">enter or edit</a> user details, you need administrator rights or <a href="Catalog.Users/Help">user list</a> manager rights. </p>
<p>Authorization of a user requires administrator's approval. </p>
<p>A user list manager can edit the user list (to a limited degree), configure users prior to their authorization approval by administrator, edit the <strong>Users</strong> list and the <strong>User groups</strong> list, and edit user access rights.</p>
<p>Other users are only allowed to view their personal data, change their <strong>Password</strong> (if not restricted by administrator), edit their contact information, and select application interface language.</p>
<p>In a distributed infobase, authorization is configured for each infobase separately.</p>
<h3>Setting and changing passwords</h3>
<ul><li>
<div>Users can view their profiles in the application.</div>
</li><li>
<div>An administrator or user can <a href="CommonForm.ChangePassword/Help">set a password</a> or change a password if necessary in case they have rights to do it.</div>
</li><li>
<div>by clicking <strong>Set password</strong>. If the password is already set, you can change it. To change a password, click <strong>Change password</strong> and enter the <a href="CommonForm.ChangePassword/Help">new password</a>.</div></li></ul><h3>Recommendations on creating passwords</h3>

</li><li>Lowercase Latin letters. 
</li><li>numbers 
</li><li>Special characters (such as underscore and parentheses). </li></ul></li></ul><p>Passwords that contain numbers only, human-readable words, or periodic character sequences, as well as passwords identical to usernames are not recommended. </p>
<ul><li>Examples of strong passwords: <br>“nj7{jhjibq*Gfhjkm<br>F5”njnGhkmNj;t{HI

<p>After a user list manager creates a user and specifies their username, a recommendation to approve their authorization settings is displayed to administrators in the user profile. Once an administrator approves authorization for this user, the recommendation is hidden and the manager is no longer able to change the authorization settings in any way, with the exception of revoking the authorization approval. To view the list of users that require approval, filter the user list by the <strong>Requires approval</strong> field. </p>
<p>The user details window contains the following tabs: </p>
<ul><li><strong>Main</strong> 
<ul><li>Specify the <strong>Full name</strong> of the user. This name will be displayed in application lists and reports. 
</li><li>The <strong>Invalid</strong> check box is cleared for all users by default. If a user no longer uses the application (for instance, due to resignation) yet cannot be deleted due to being referenced by other objects, it is recommended that you select the <strong>Invalid</strong> check box for them. An invalid user is not displayed in the user list, and they cannot be selected, for example, as task performer or person responsible for a document. To restore the user to a valid status (for example, they have been rehired), clear this check box. 
</li><li><strong>Username</strong>. A short name used to sign in to the application. It can differ from the full name (a user can have username "JSmith" and full name "John Smith"). 
</li><li><strong>1C:Enterprise authentication</strong>. This is the default option. 
<ul><li>1C:Enterprise authentication status is displayed under the check box.</li></ul></li><li>To set a password, click <strong>Set Password</strong> and <a href="CommonForm.ChangePassword/Help">enter</a> it. Never leave this field blank as it compromises security. 
<ul><li>If the user is not saved, you will be prompted to save it. Click <strong>Save</strong>. 
</li><li>Once the password is set, the authentication status changes to <strong>The password is set</strong>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Require to change a password when signed in</strong>. Select this check box to require the user to set a new password when they sign in for the first time. This check box is selected for all users by default. To ensure data security, it is recommended that all users change the passwords preset by administrators when they sign in for the first time. 
</li><li><strong>Show in selection list</strong>. Indicates whether the username is added to the selection list displayed at the application startup. If any external users are registered in the application, it is recommended that you clear this check box. If this check box is cleared, the user will be hidden from the list displayed at the application startup. 
</li><li><strong>User cannot change password</strong>. Select this check box to prohibit the user from changing their password. In this case only administrator can change the password. This makes the <strong>Set password</strong> and <strong>Change password</strong> buttons unavailable to the user. 
</li><li><strong>OpenID authentication</strong>. Select this check box to allow the user to sign in using an OpenID account. This feature is used in 1C:Enterprise web client. If you select this check box, also select the <strong>1C:Enterprise authentication</strong> check box. Otherwise the application might work incorrectly.

The user will be able to sign in to the application with this username. If you select this check box, you can clear the <strong>1C:Enterprise authentication</strong> check box.</li></ul></li><li>If none of the <strong>Authentication</strong> check boxes are selected, the <strong>Can sign in</strong> check box is automatically cleared. 
</li><li><strong>Run mode</strong>. The default value is <strong>Auto</strong>. This is the recommended <a href="v8help://frame/InformationEntryToForm">mode</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Addresses and phones</strong>
